Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement reduces accidents and incidents caused by in-flight icing encounters by implementing automatic ice detection and alerting systems on new type designs of turboprop airplanes that have non-evaporative ice-protection systems and non-powered flight controls, and will be operated in commercial passenger and cargo revenue service. These systems should:

Automatically detect ice;
Measure the rate of ice accretion: and
Provide annunciation to the flightcrew.
