Background
This safety enhancement reduces loss of control fatal accidents by recommending amended icing certification criteria for new airplane designs not equipped with evaporative (i.e., hot wing) systems. The criteria would include performance and handling quality requirements for:

Residual ice;
Inter-cycle ice;
Delayed anti-icing/de-icing system activation; and
De-icing/anti-icing system malfunction.
