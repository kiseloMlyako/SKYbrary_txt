Have you seen this error before?
Human error is a part of life that can rarely be eliminated entirely. Disciplinary actions are usually not appropriate when slips, lapses or mistakes have been made because they can lead to a feeling of injustice, but many things can be done to prevent their (re-)occurrence. To determine the right course of action, once you have established the behaviour of the person in question is a slip or lapse, one has to ask the question: "does this happen a lot"? Humans are not machines, and they will make human errors. Ordinary people may repetitively complete a procedure ten times in a row without an error. A specifically trained human operator could perhaps do this a hundred times in a row without errors.



 

 


 

 


 

 








If this is the first time it happened, select the left icon.
If indeed this happens more often, does it happen with the same person (select middle icon) or does it happen with different people or operators (select right icon)?









Explanation routine
Have you seen this before?
The Routine Test is designed to find out more about the person - event combination that was concerned with the particular error or procedural deviation.
Three classes are possible here:

This is the first time it happened.
This occurred more than once by the same person.
Everybody does it like that.

Depending on the characteristic of the safety behaviour, one can understand there are different possible follow-ups.
