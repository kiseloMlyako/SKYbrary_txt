Long range wide-body airliner. In service since 1994, developed on the basis of the A-300B4. Offers the same engines as the shorter A-310 suited for mid range operations. With both powerplants, the A300-600 and AIRBUS A-310 are fully certified for up to 180 minutes extended-range twin-engine operations (Extended Range Twin Engine Operation), which permits their use on routes over water and across remote regions of the globe. Total of 553 were built (together with the A30B) and 416 remain in operation (August 2006).
