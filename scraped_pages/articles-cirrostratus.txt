Description
High level, uniform layer of thin white cloud.

Layer of cirrostratus seen from above at 34,000ft. In the distance a Cumulonimbus (Cb) cloud can be seen pushing up through the Tropopause. Photo by Captain Murray O'Shea
Characteristics
Viewed from below the cloud, the sun and moon may be seen to have a bright halo with a red tinge to the edges.
Because of the high altitude, and therefore low temperature, cirrostratus clouds are composed of ice crystals rather than water particles.
