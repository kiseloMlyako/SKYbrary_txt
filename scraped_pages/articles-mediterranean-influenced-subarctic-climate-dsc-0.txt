Dsc: D = Continental  s = Dry summer  c = cool summer
Description
Mediterranean-influenced subarctic climate; significant seasonal changes in temperatures with the coldest month averaging below 0 °C and 1–3 months averaging above 10 °C. At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than 30 mm. But overall, these climates are dry.
The Dsc climate is rare and found in very small areas at high elevation around the Mediterranean Basin, northwestern states/provinces of USA/Canada eastern highland areas of Turkey and the far east of Russia.
