Definition
Air Man-Machine Integrated Design and Analysis System
Description
A predictive model of human operator performance (flight crew and ATC) to evaluate the impact of automation developments in flight management and air traffic control. The model is used to predict the performance of flight crews and ATC operators interacting with automated systems in a dynamic airspace environment. The purpose of the modelling is to support evaluation and design of automated aids for flight management and airspace management and to predict required changes in both domains.
Air MIDAS was developed by members of the HAIL (Human Automation Integration Laboratory) at SJSU (San Jose State University) over the past 15 years. It is currently being used for the examination of advanced air traffic management concepts in projects sponsored by NASA ARC (Ames Research Center) and EUROCONTROL.
