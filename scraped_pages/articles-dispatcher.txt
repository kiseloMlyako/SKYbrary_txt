Description
The job title of 'Dispatcher' is often given to a non aircrew person with line responsibility for supporting the safe and expeditious departure of flights. In some Regulatory Systems, notably the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) model, employment as a person with such responsibility, in particular for Aircraft Load and Trim being in accordance with all limitations, involves a strict definition which requires that a specified licence shall be held. Elsewhere, there are no regulatory requirements related to the job function of persons who are employed in this role and the job title ‘Dispatcher’ has no commonly-agreed scope and alternative titles for equivalent responsibilities are also found.
