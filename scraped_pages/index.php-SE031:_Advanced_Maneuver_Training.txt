Background
Advanced Maneuver Training (AMT) refers to training to prevent and recover from hazardous flight conditions outside of the normal flight envelope. Examples include in-flight upsets, stalls, ground proximity and wind shear escape maneuvers, and inappropriate energy state management conditions.
This safety enhancement collects and provides advanced maneuver training material and encourages Part 121 operators to use these materials to implement advanced maneuver ground and flight training using appropriate flight training equipment. Emphasis should be given to stall onset recognition and recovery, unusual attitudes, upset recoveries, effects of icing, energy awareness and management, and causal factors that can lead to loss of control.
Additionally, research should be conducted to determine how existing flight simulation devices may be used effectively in AMT.
