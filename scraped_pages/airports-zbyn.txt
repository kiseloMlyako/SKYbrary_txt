Description
Taiyuan Wusu International Airport is an airport in Taiyuan, Shanxi, People’s Republic of China. It is the largest airport in Shanxi Province and is located about 15 km southeast of downtown Taiyuan.
Climatology
Taiyuan experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). Spring is dry, with frequent dust storms, followed by early summer heat waves. Summer tends to be warm to hot with most of the year's rainfall concentrated in July and August. Winter is long and cold, but dry and sunny. Because of the aridity, there tends be considerable diurnal variation in temperature, except during the summer. Conditions are much cooler than comparable-latitude cities, such as Shijiazhuang, due to the moderately high altitude. Monthly mean temperatures range from −5.5 °C in January to 23.4 °C in July, for an annual mean of 10.0 °C.
