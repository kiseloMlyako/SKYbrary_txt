  A310, Irkutsk Russia, 2006









Summary

On 8 July 2006, S7 Airlines A310 overran the runway on landing at Irkutsk at high speed and was destroyed after the Captain mismanaged the thrust levers whilst attempting to apply reverse only on one engine because the flight was being conducted with one reverser inoperative. The Investigation noted that the aircraft had been despatched on the accident flight with the left engine thrust reverser de-activated as permitted under the MEL but also that the previous two flights had been carried out with a deactivated right engine thrust reverser.

Description
On 8 July 2006, an AIRBUS A-310 being operated by S7 Airlines on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Moscow Domodedovo to Irkutsk failed to stop on the runway after a daylight touchdown at destination in normal ground visibility and after a high speed overrun eventually hit significant obstructions, caught fire and was destroyed. Of 203 occupants, 125 were killed, 41 suffered serious injury and 22 suffered minor injuries.
Investigation
An Investigation was carried out by the Interstate Aviation Committee. It was found that the aircraft had been despatched on the accident flight with the left engine thrust reverser de-activated as permitted under the Minimum Equipment List (MEL). It was noted that the previous two flights had been carried out with a deactivated right engine thrust reverser.
After a touchdown within the touchdown zone (TDZ) following a non precision approach, it was found that the aircraft commander as PF had unintentionally moved the thrust lever for the left engine into the forward thrust range whilst using reverse thrust on the right engine. The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced to the stowed position and remained there whilst the left engine thrust lever reached a position corresponding to around 60% of its rated takeoff thrust where it remained until the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) stopped recording. It was concluded that the flight crew had not noticed the forward thrust on the left engine. The minimum speed, reached at 20 seconds after touchdown, was found to have been approximately 90 knots. Thereafter, the thrust on the left engine led to acceleration to nearly 100 knots where it remained until the aircraft left the runway. A call by the PF for engine shutdown was made as the aircraft left the runway but was not actioned.
The MEL was found to include an explicit warning that “pilots must hold the thrust lever (of an engine with a de-activated thrust reverser) in the idle position during a landing run to prevent any inadvertent movement of the thrust lever in a forward thrust direction”.
It was noted that flight crew co-operation had been poor with deficient monitoring by the First Officer who was inexperienced on the aircraft type. The Captain was found to have had no experience as a First Officer on a two crew aircraft type prior to becoming qualified on the A310
It was also noted that although the runway was reported in accordance with prevailing procedures as having ‘good braking action’, it was actually ‘covered with water’ However this fact was not considered to have materially affected the outcome.
A range of concerns relating to the evacuation of the aircraft were expressed, both in respect of the ability of the cabin crew to facilitate the evacuation and in respect of the ability of the Rescue and Fire Fighting Services to respond effectively.
A total of 57 Safety Recommendations were made as a result of the Investigation as follows:
To the Aviation Authorities of Russia:

To carry out a comparative analysis of the specificities of operating airplanes of Russian and Western manufacturers;


Until the necessary changes have been made by the developer of the A-310 airplane that are aimed at unifying the procedures for using the engines’ reverse thrust in various situations, to exclude the use (apart from special or emergency situations) of reverse thrust on one engine if the other is deactivated. To take into account this fact when calculating the necessary take-off and landing distances;


In accordance with article 33 of the Air Code of the Russian Federation and article 83bis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, to accomplish the mandatory conclusion of Agreements on continued airworthiness when allowing airlines of the Russian Federation to operate aircraft of foreign registration.

During the period of developing the new edition of the section to prolong the effectiveness of the previous rules of selection, as confirmed by the Minister of Civil Aviation in the “Guide to professional, psychological and physiological selection in civil aviation” (1986);


When selecting candidates for conversion to a new aircraft type, to oblige physical evaluation board and airline psychologists to pay particular attention to any candidates’ personal qualities affecting the processes of emotional reaction and behaviour in non-standard conditions (increased tension and stress), and, when identifying any unfavourable signs, to approach more severely the resolution of any question of their suitability for conversion training and/or the need for an individual approach in conversion training;


To ensure the high-quality and thorough investigation of air incidents according to ICAO Annex 13 and the development of specific recommendations on preventing similar occurrences in the future;


To equip at least two devices at Irkutsk airport with modern units for measuring, processing and recording the results of measuring the friction coefficient to replace the visual recording equipment being used.

Together with the scientific research organizations, to conduct investigations and prepare recommendations on extinguishing combined fires on aircraft;


To consider the possibility of developing and providing special clothing for rescue workers when working close to centre of open fire;


To complete the number of departmental search and rescue fire brigades in accordance with the prescribed standards.

To S7 Airlines:
