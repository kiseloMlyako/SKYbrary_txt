Description
A coastal, localised wind that blows from sea to land, caused by the temperature difference when the sea surface is colder than the adjacent land.
A sea breeze usually blows on relatively calm, sunny, summer days, and alternates with the oppositely directed, usually weaker, night time land breeze. As the sea breeze regime progresses, the wind develops a component parallel to the coast, owing to the Coriolis deflection.
