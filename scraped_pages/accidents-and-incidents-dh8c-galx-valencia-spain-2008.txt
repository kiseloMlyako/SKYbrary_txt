Description
On 11 February 2008, a Gulfstream G200 being operated on a public transport passenger charter flight by Executive Airlines had landed on Runway 30 at Valencia and cleared the Runway to the right to taxi back on the parallel taxiway before stopping at a later intersection to wait for clearance to cross the same runway to the South Apron. The next aircraft to land, A DHC8-300 being operated by Air Nostrum on a scheduled passenger flight cleared Runway 30 further down and then also exited to the right and was cleared to taxi along it to the North Apron past the waiting Gulfstream. Although it was dark, the DHC8 crew believed that there would be sufficient clearance to safely pass the stopped aircraft but this turned out not to be the case and as a consequence of the ensuing slight collision, minor damage was caused to both aircraft.
The Investigation
An Accident Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Accident Investigation Agency, the Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC). They determined that the cause of the collision was the inappropriate clearance given by ATC to the DHC8 to continue taxing on the parallel taxiway and the subsequent misjudgment made by the DHC8 crew as to safe clearance. They noted that the Gulfstream was stopped at the correct point and that a larger aircraft in the same position would have visibly blocked the parallel taxiway, this precluding the possibility of a collision. Aspects of the design of the airport in relation to the accident were examined and, whilst found to be not directly relevant to the collision, it was determined that various markings, lights and signs were not correctly represented on the AIP Aerodrome Chart and that some were not in accordance with Annex 14 SARPs. A corresponding Safety Recommendation was made to the Airport Operator and accepted.
