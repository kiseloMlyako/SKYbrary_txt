Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of approach and landing accidents resulting from go-around-related aeronautical decision making or undesired aircraft states during the go-around maneuver.  The SE recommends that Air Carriers evaluate their go-around policies according to the ALG JASIT toolkit (Go-Around Decision Map and its accompanying narrative) and FAA Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) 15004, Scenario-Based Go-Around Training to evaluate current/new potential areas for improving pilot decision making and compliance with operator go-around standard operating procedures (SOP) and revise their go-around-related training curricula accordingly.
