Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of loss-of-control accidents by having Air Carriers develop and implement improved SOPs (SOPs) to reduce flight crew member loss of airplane state awareness.
In a Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents, insufficient adherence to SOPs was a factor in 15 events. To improve flight crew adherence to SOPs and reduce the risk of lost awareness of airplane state, air carriers should:

Review, and update as needed, current SOPs for consistency with the CAST Plan, manufacturer recommendations, and air traffic control (ATC) procedures;
Assess level of adherence to current SOPs, identifying possible reasons for insufficient adherence to certain procedures;
Develop training programs to provide pilots with rationale for SOPs, focusing on those with lower adherence rates.
