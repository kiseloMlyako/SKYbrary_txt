Description
Iskandariyah Airport is located 40 km south of Baghdad, near the Euphrates River.
Climatology
Hot Desert Climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) - Hot desert climates are typically found in the subtropics where there is unbroken sunshine for the whole year due to the stable descending air and high pressure, little or no precipitation. Maximum temperatures of 40°C to 45°C are not uncommon, particularly during the warmer months of the year. During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, very rarely do temperatures drop far below freezing.
