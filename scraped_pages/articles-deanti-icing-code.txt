Description
It is crucial to the effectiveness of aircraft ground de/anti icing that the aircraft commander receives accurate information on the fluid treatment carried out. This should be achieved by the use of a standard format Anti Icing Code to ensure that there is no possibility of mis-understanding in respect of the minimum required information. Relevant additional information can and should be passed as well.
The Anti Icing Code Procedure, as described in the AEA Guidelines (see further reading), should be incorporated in the operational procedures for all aircraft operators and de-icing service providers.
The Code communicates the following information to the aircraft commander by referring to the last step of the fluid treatment procedure in the following sequence:

the fluid type - Type 1 Fluid, Type 2 Fluid, Type 3 Fluid or Type 4 Fluid
the fluid concentration within the fluid/water mixture, expressed as a percentage by volume (this is not required for Type 1 Fluid)
the local time in hours and minutes at the beginning of the final (or only) de-icing/anti-icing step
(optionally, for Type 2 and 4 Fluids only) the complete name of the anti-icing fluid (the “brand name”)
the statement "post de-icing/anti-icing check completed".

By Example: A de-icing/anti-icing procedure in which the last step was the use of a mixture of 75% of a type 2 fluid and 25% water which commenced at 1335 local time is communicated as follows:
“TYPE 2/75 1335 [optional complete name of anti-icing fluid] post de-icing/anti-icing check completed”
Communication of the anti icing code and any related supplementary information can be by R/T, intercom or message board display.
For Record keeping purposes at the service provider, the date of the treatment should also be recorded in the sequence day, month, year.
