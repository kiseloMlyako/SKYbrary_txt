Description
The Dutch Safety Board (DSB) is an independent administrative body that investigates specific accidents and incidents as well as broader safety issues and unsafe situations.
The DSB, which operates independently from the government of The Netherlands and other parties, decides for itself which incidents and subjects its will investigate and focuses primarily on cases where citizens depend on other parties -- i.e., the government, businesses or institutions -- to ensure their safety. The purpose of the Board's investigations is to learn from the incidents and make recommendations in order to improve safety. Its investigations do not address issues of blame or liability.
Authorizations
The DSB is authorized to conduct investigations in a wide range of sectors, including aviation, shipping, rail, chemical and petrochemical industries, construction, healthcare and military incidents. At an international level, the Board plays a role in carrying out safety investigations under international treaties and European legislation.
