Since the introduction of the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), a number of studies relating to its performance and safety have been commissioned by EUROCONTROL. On this page, we provide a list of the studies (in the chronological order), their brief description and links to documents and presentations with details findings and conclusions.
ACASA: Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems Analysis (2001-2002, updated 2009)
A series of studies, supporting the mandate and implementation of ACAS II in Europe (2002):

IAPA: Implications on ACAS Performances due to ASAS implementation (2005)
The interaction between ACAS II and the operational use of the future Airborne Separation Assurance Systems (ASAS) has been thoroughly investigated within the scope of the IAPA project. The IAPA project analyses potential operational and safety implications, and provides guidelines for the development of future ASAS applications in Europe.

Implications on ACAS Performance

ASARP: ACAS Safety Analysis post-RVSM Project (2006)
ASARP measured and analysed the actual safety performance of ACAS II in European Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) airspace.

Final report on the safety of ACAS II in the European RVSM environment

Safety Benefit of ACAS II on Helicopters (2006-2008)
EUROCONTROL conducted a study to assess the feasibility and potential safety benefits of fitting ACAS II to helicopters. In parallel, a UK helicopter operator performed trial installation and operational evaluation on one of its helicopters.

PASS Project: Performance and Safety Aspects of Short-term Conflict Alert (2007-2010)
The objective of PASS is to examine the performance of the ground-based Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) and interactions between operational use of STCA and ACAS.

EUROCONTROL Pass Project – more information and deliverables.

Investigation and analysis of TCAS II safety issues in the European airspace (2009)
The present study has reviewed the computations made previously with the most recent (2009) UK and French radar data. Additionally, the correctness of pilot responses to TCAS RA was examined.

CAUSE: Collision Avoidance Requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (2010)
Study of Collision Avoidance Requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems was started in April 2009. The evolution of aerospace technologies in the field of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), including autonomous operations, will impact European ATM as regards new military and civil applications. The CAUSE study will assess various aspects of potential UAS equipage with a collision avoidance system in addition to the sense and avoid functionality.
