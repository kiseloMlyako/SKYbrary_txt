Expectation in ATC
Expectation bias in ATC can be defined as having a strong belief or mindset towards a particular outcome.
This can occur even when there is evidence to the contrary.
Types of biases can include:

Hindsight and Outcome Bias
Local Rationality

The following activities can be undertaken to reduce the likelihood of prolonged expectation bias leading to near misses, incidents and accidents:

Highlight where and when expectation bias has or is likely to occur (through lessons learned and / or relevant examples).
Design software that is usable and specifically highlight safety significant information.
Highlight where accepted procedures deviate from the normal (e.g. routing practices).
