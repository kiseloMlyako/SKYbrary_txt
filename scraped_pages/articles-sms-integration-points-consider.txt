Description
The intent of this document is to provide the reader with best practices concerning the integration of multiple management systems within organizations. The document considers multiple scenarios relating to the integration of operating systems and does not exclusively deal with safety management systems (SMS). It does, however, cover many key areas that might require attention and review and provides the reader with advice in respect to successful systems integration.
Additionally, this document provides guidance to other regulators in respect to the integration of other legislated and non-legislated systems (e.g., occupational health and safety, environment) into the safety management environment. In addition, it covers a variety of integration scenarios and offers useful tips on how to deal with these situations.
The document builds on the experience of Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG) members and wherever possible provides the reader with additional reading to further their knowledge of the subject.
