Description
Realignment of the Mental ModelÂ - Individuals do not constantly update or re-evaluate the evidence relevant to their beliefs. During novel situations involving problem solving, if a situation arises that challenges an individual to reassess his or her mental model, the individual will not consider it necessary to go back and reassess all of the evidence that was ever considered in creating the mental model (Ross and Anderson, 1982). Rather, individuals will try to adjust their mental model with the new immediate information at hand. The result is that, although they may attempt to realign their model given the current situation, individuals are unlikely to go back and reconsider their previous actions.
