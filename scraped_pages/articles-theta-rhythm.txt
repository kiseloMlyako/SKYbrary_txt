Description
Traditionally, the traces obtained by Electroencephalography are analysed by Fourier analysis, which decomposes any signal into sine-wave components with varying frequencies. The ‘alpha’ rhythm is usually the most strongly marked, particularly from the optical lobes, situated at the rear of the brain.
Discussion/References
The EEG Theta Rhythm occurs in the range approximately 4-7 Hz . It appears to be associated with the learning of unfamiliar procedures, such as a different interface from that used in the normal working environment.

Cabon et al carried out a series of small-scale experiments using a TRACON II simulator at EEC during 1997-8, followed by applications to real time simulation 1999- 2000
Cabon et al (1997) showed significant differences in the intensity of theta rhythm during the learning of the TRACON system, falling off as the controllers learned the system.
Cabon et al (1998) detected significant increases in theta rhythm in the left frontal zone (not the right) during learning of an unfamiliar interface. Because all subjects in that experiment were right handed this suggested that the verbal component was dominant. Experienced controllers learned relatively faster than trainees.
Cabon et al (1999a) examined medial front (Fz) Theta activity for controllers in a full-scale real-time simulation, and found appreciable theta band activity, decreasing only after five days experience with a radically new interface – some time after the controllers considered themselves to have learned the system

Generics


Type of method
Electroencephalography


Target of method
Strain


The presence of Alpha rhythm EEG is conventionally taken as an indication that the brain is ‘idling’.


Time Scale of method
Seconds, Minutes


EEG signals have a frequency range up to 30-40Hz. To carry out Fourier analysis epochs of several seconds are needed.


Portability of method
No


It is sufficiently difficult to obtain EEG readings under laboratory conditions, and usually requires a trolley of equipment for each individual.


Observer Effect
No


The activity recorded by EEG measurements is not normally under the control of the controller. (It is possible to ‘train’ oneself to generate alpha rhythms, a process which is sometimes employed as a mechanical aid to meditation).

Potential problems with the method


Failure risk
Moderate


Surprisingly good quality EEG signals can be recorded in simulation and in real life control rooms. This is probably because most electronic activity in these locations involves much higher frequencies.


Bias risk
Possible


We do not really know enough about EEG to say what it can be affected by, although some observation of specific elements is available. On some occasions alpha rhythm has been observed in subjects under extreme strain. This paradoxical effect may be connected with the generation of alpha rhythm when the eyes are closed, and with the tendency to blink under strain.


Ethical problems
Medical


We do not examine EEG records for traces of abnormality, which is the proper study of the medical profession.


Costs of the method


Staff Cost
High


Electroencephalography usually needs at least one post-doctoral level supervisor, a skilled EEG technician and one specially trained observer per controller observed.


Set-up Cost
High


EEG requires expensive equipment, and considerable preparation before each exercise.


Running Cost
High


EEG tends to require specialised recording equipment, and the volume of data produced usually requires considerable control activity in the course of a simulation.


Analysis Cost
High


The cost of EEG analysis is largely that of the specialised programs, and peripherals required. Most EEG systems, having been designed for clinical use, are self contained, and require considerable attention in use.


Analysis data


Analysis Speed
Slow


Although EEG analysis is usually carried out by computer, the interpretation of the analysis usually seems to contain a certain subjective element. In addition, EEG is liable to artefacts, usually due to displacement of cable leads, or chewing or blinking by the subject.


Data Automation
Yes


Data can only be collected automatically.


Analysis Automation
No


The analysis of EEG is, in general, automated - usually by Fourier analysis, but the interpretation of the results is not normally susceptible to automation.


Status
Tested


This method has been used in a number of relevant studies, at EEC and elsewhere.
