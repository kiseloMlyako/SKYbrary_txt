Description
Joint use public and military (ANG) international airport serving Tuscon, Arizona.
Climatology
Tucson has a desert climate (Köppen climate classification Bwh) with two major seasons, summer and winter. In addition, there are three minor seasons: fall, spring, and the monsoon. The monsoon can begin any time from mid-June to late July, with an average start date around July 3. It typically continues through August and into early September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than experienced during the rest of the year. Clouds build up from the south in the early afternoon and can result in intense thunderstorms and heavy rainfall which can cause flash floods. Although Tucson receives more precipitation than most other locations with desert climates, it still qualifies due to its high evapotranspiration rate.
