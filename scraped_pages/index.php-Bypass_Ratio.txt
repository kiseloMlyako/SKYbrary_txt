Description
In a turbofan (bypass) engine, the bypass ratio is a comparison between the mass flow rate of air drawn into the engine through the fan disk that goes around the engine core with the mass flow rate of the air that goes through the engine core. In an engine with a bypass ration of 10:1, for every 11 units of air drawn into the engine, 10 will bypass the engine core and 1 will go through it.
