SES Basic Regulations



Description
The SES legislative framework consists of five basic Regulations (No 549/2004, 550/2004, 551/2004, 552/2004 and 2018/1139) covering the provision of air navigation services (ANS), the organisation and use of airspace, the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management Network (EATMN) and the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation and of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
These Regulations were amended in 2009 by Regulations No 1070/2009 and No 1108/2009.
A set of Implementing Rules (IRs), adopted by the European Commission, supports the implementation of each basic Regulation.
