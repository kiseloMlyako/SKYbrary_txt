Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement develops and implements a plan to install Visual Glide Slope Indicators (VGSI) at each runway end of runways used by air carriers.
Completed Outputs
New precision-like instrument approach procedures to all runway ends required VGSI lighting at all runway ends used by air carriers. FAAâ€™s Air Traffic System Requirements (ARS) developed a plan, and installation has begun.
