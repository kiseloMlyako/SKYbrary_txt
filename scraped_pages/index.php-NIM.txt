Maritime patrol and ELINT aircraft. In service from 1969 to 2011. Initially developed for Royal Air Force as a replacement for the Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft and based on the De Havilland Comet 4 airliner. Various upgraded versions with various mission capabilities were progressively introduced.
Note: The ICAO Designator NIM has been removed from ICAO Doc 8643 as aircraft of this type noÂ longer exist in airworthy condition.
