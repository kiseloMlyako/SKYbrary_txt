Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement recommends a shared responsibility to ensure clear understanding of specific control instructions through the use of read-backs of any clearance to enter a specific runway, hold short of a specific runway, or “taxi into position and hold” instructions. It is currently the sole responsibility of the controller to seek and receive acknowledgement for these instructions.
The intent of this safety enhancement has been implemented through Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Policy.
