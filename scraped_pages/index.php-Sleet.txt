Definition
A mixture of rain and snow.
Description
As snow falls it may pass through a warm layer of air causing some of the snow to melt and turn into Rain. The resulting precipitation is therefore a mix of rain and snow.
Sleet, often associated with what weather forecasters call “a wintery shower”, can reduce braking action on runways and aerodrome operating surfaces and should, therefore, be treated with caution.
