Introduction
Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 and its subsequent amendments lay down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to air operations pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council ("Basic Regulation").
This Regulation is officially referred to as IR-OPS (Implementing Rules – Operations), but it is also known as EASA OPS or EASA AIR OPS. It replaces EU-OPS (Regulation (EC) 859/2008) with regard to commercial operations of aeroplanes (A) and JAR-OPS 3 with regard to commercial operations of helicopters (H) as well as old national requirements on commercial operations of sailplanes (S) and balloons (B) and existing national requirements on non-commercial operations of complex and other-than-complex aircraft (including S and B) and specialised air operations (most notably aerial work). The Regulation establishes also detailed rules for ramp inspections of aircraft of operators under the safety oversight of another State when landed at aerodromes located in the territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty.
Entry into Force
Annexes I to V of the Regulation – covering authority, organisational, commercial air transport operational requirements and operations requiring specific approval – became applicable as of 28 October 2012. The deadline for establishing compliance with annexes I-V of the Regulation was 28 October 2014.
Annexes VI to VIII of the Regulation, as later amended by Regulation (EU) No 800/2013, became applicable as of 25 August 2016 (non-commercial operations) and 21 April 2017 (specialised operations).
Scope
The following types of civil air operations are within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 and its subsequent amendments:

Specialised and non-specialised;
Commercial and non-commercial;
With complex motor-powered aircraft and with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft;

Specialised operations
The term ‘specialised operations’ refers to activities meeting the following criteria:

the aircraft is flown close to the surface to fulfil the mission;
abnormal manoeuvres are performed;
special equipment is necessary to fulfil the mission and which affects the manoeuvrability of the aircraft;
substances are released from the aircraft during the flight where these substances are either harmful or affect the manoeuvrability of the aircraft;
external loads or goods are lifted or towed; or
persons enter or leave the aircraft during flight.

Operations not meeting the above criteria are ‘non-specialised’.
Commercial operations
The term ‘commercial’ refers to aircraft operations involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire.
Operations involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail not for remuneration or hire are ‘non-commercial’.
Complex aircraft
The term ‘complex motor-powered aircraft’ refers to:

an aeroplane:

with a maximum certificated take-off mass exceeding 5,700 kg; or
certificated for a maximum passenger seating configuration of more than nineteen; or
certificated for operation with a minimum crew of at least two pilots; or
equipped with (a) turbojet engine(s) or more than one turboprop engine; or


a helicopter certificated:

for a maximum take-off mass exceeding 3,175 kg; or
for a maximum passenger seating configuration of more than nine; or
for operation with a minimum crew of at least two pilots; or


a tilt rotor aircraft.

An aircraft not meeting the above criteria is an ‘other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft’.

Highlights
Important changes mandated by Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, in comparison with EU-OPS and JAR OPS-3, are safety management and fatigue risk management.
Safety management
ORO.GEN.200 (Management system), on top of requiring a function to monitor compliance of the operator with the relevant requirements (the old quality system of EU-OPS and JAR OPS-3), requires the practice of safety management – in accordance with ICAO Annex 19 and Doc 9859 - in the identification of aviation safety hazards entailed by the activities of the operator, their evaluation and the management of associated risks, including taking actions to mitigate the risk and verify their effectiveness. This requirement is applicable to specialised and non-specialised commercial operators and non-commercial operators of complex aircraft.
Fatigue risk management (FRM)
ORO.FTL.120 (FRM) requires commercial operators of aeroplanes to establish, implement and maintain FRM as an integral part of their management system. FRM requirements include the establishment of a hazard identification and risk assessment process that allows managing the operational risk(s) of the operator arising from crew member fatigue on a continuous basis. Requirements further include a risk mitigation process that provides for remedial actions to be implemented promptly, which are necessary to effectively mitigate the operator’s risk(s) arising from crew member fatigue and for continuous monitoring and regular assessment of the mitigation of fatigue risks achieved by such actions. FRM requirements also mandate FRM safety assurance and promotion processes. Air taxi, emergency medical service and single pilot CAT operations by aeroplanes are not required to comply with FRM requirements.
