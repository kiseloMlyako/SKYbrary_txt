The 777-200LR became the world's longest-range commercial airliner when it entered service in 2006. It has a maximum range of 9,395 nm and was intended for ultra-long-haul routes such as New York to Singapore, or Chicago to Sydney - up to about 19 hours flying time. The -200LR features an increased MTOW and the same wing as the 777-300ER. The 777F is a cargo version of this variant. Three optional auxiliary fuel tanks take the baseline fuel tank capacity from 181,289 l to 203,570 l. Other new features include raked wingtips, redesigned main landing gear, and additional structural strengthening. As with the -300ER, the -200LR is equipped with wingtip extensions of 3.90 m. B77L is member of the B777 family of aircraft.
