Description
On 14 January 2008, a Hawker Beechcraft Corporation 1900C being operated by Alpine Air on a non-scheduled mail flight from Honolulu to Lihue on the island of Kauai as AP 253 and on an IFR flight plan in night VMC disappeared from radar on final approach to destination shortly after a related MSAW alert had been annunciated. The aircraft was subsequently found to have crashed.
Investigation
The NTSB carried out an investigation, It was found that during descent to 2000 feet QNH at pilot's discretion, the controller had advised that other traffic would be overtaking him and that he should expect a visual approach at Lihue number 2 to the other aircraft. The flight was then transferred to advisory frequency and was subsequently lost from radar about 6.5 miles south-southeast of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot presumed killed. It was concluded that the 38 year-old pilot had become spatially disoriented and had lost control of the aircraft.
The formal determination of Probable Cause was "the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness.
Two Contributory Factors were also identified:

the dark night conditions


the task requirements of simultaneously monitoring the cockpit instruments and the (position of the) other airplane.

The Final Report of the Investigation was adopted on 6 May 2009.
