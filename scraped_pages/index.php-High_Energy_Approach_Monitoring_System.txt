Description
High Energy Approach Monitoring Systems are intended to predict the specific aircraft energy state at the touchdown zone of the runway. This predicted energy is compared with predetermined threshold specific energy. An alert is generated when the predicted energy is too high or too low.
The alert by High Energy Approach Monitoring Systems may include a message that is indicative of an aircraft altitude that is higher than a predetermined glide slope when the predicted specific potential energy is at least the predetermined threshold specific potential energy. Also, the alert may include a message that is indicative of an aircraft speed that is faster than a predetermined ground speed when the predicted specific kinetic energy is at least the predetermined threshold specific kinetic energy. Further, the alert may include a message that is indicative of an aircraft altitude that is higher than the predetermined glide slope and an aircraft speed that is faster than the predetermined ground speed when the predicted specific total kinetic energy is at least the predetermined threshold specific total energy.
