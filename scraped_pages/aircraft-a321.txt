Short to medium range single aisle airliner. In service since 1994. There are two version: 100 and 200. MTOW for the A321-100 is Mass 83,000kg optional Mass 85,000kg. MTOW for the A321-200 is Mass 89,000kg optional Mass 93,500kg. The A321 is the stretched fuselage variant of the A320 family of aircraft. A321 has Approach Category C to 75.5 tonnes MLW and D beyond that to 77.8 tonnes.
A new "neo" (new engine option) series of the A320 family was developed since 2010 with first aircraft being delivered in 2016. The "neo" aircraft feature new engines (PW 1100G or CFM LEAP-1A) and a new type of wingtips, called "sharklets". The existing aircraft are referred to as "ceo" by Airbus, meaning "current engine option".
Note: While a "ceo" aircraft may or may not be equipped with sharklets, all "neo" aircraft are equipped with sharklets. The sharklet version features a 1.7m wider wingspan.
