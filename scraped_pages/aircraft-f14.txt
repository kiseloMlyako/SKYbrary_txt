Carrier borne air defence/ air superiority fighter. In service since 1972 (F-14B since 1988). Developed in many versions with different engines. Re-engined version F-14A and re-designated to F-14B. The F-14 has in the late 90s been modified into being able to perform bombing and rescue missions. Further version F-14D Super Tomcat with digital avionics dropped due to reduced budget.
