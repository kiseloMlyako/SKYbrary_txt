Description
The purpose of Software Analysis for Flight Exceedance (SAFE) is to analyse FDR data of flights. In order to obtain a significant reduction in accident rates, airlines have to be pro-active-that is, look ahead and identify potential accidents so they can be stopped before they happen. Analysis of FDR data can indicate adverse trends creeping in, which can be monitored and preventive action can be taken before a chronic breakdown of vital systems occurs.
SAFE was developed by Veesem Raytech Aerospace to help airlines achieve FOQA compliance.
