Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW)
Definition
The maximum takeoff mass (MTOM), often referred to as maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), of an aircraft is a value defined by the aircraft manufacturer. It is the maximum mass at which the aircraft is certified for take off due to structural or other limits. MTOW is usually specified in units of kilograms or pounds. The mass is a fixed value and does not vary with changes in temperature, altitude or runway available.
