Description
Radio Mandatory Zone (RMZ) means airspace of defined dimensions wherein the carriage and operation of radio equipment is mandatory.
VFR flights operating in parts of Classes E, F or G airspace and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flights operating in parts of Classes F or G airspace designated as a radio mandatory zone (RMZ) by the competent authority shall maintain continuous air-ground voice communication watch and establish two-way communication, as necessary, on the appropriate communication channel, unless in compliance with alternative provisions prescribed for that particular airspace by the competent authority.
Before entering a radio mandatory zone, an initial call containing the designation of the station being called, call sign, type of aircraft, position, level, the intentions of the flight and other information as prescribed by the competent authority, shall be made by pilots on the appropriate communication channel.
