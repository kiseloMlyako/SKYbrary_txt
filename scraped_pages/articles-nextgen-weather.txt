Description
NextGen Weather, also known as the NextGen Weather Program, is part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ongoing Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) infrastructure program to modernize the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). The intent of NextGen Weather is to reduce the impact of weather on aviation, resulting in safer, more efficient and predictable day-to-day NAS operations. Weather is the largest cause of air traffic delay in the NAS.
NexGen Weather uses computing power, advances in numerical weather forecasting, translation of weather information into airspace constraints, and modernized information management services to provide tailored aviation weather products within the NAS. These should enable air traffic controllers and aircraft operators to develop reliable flight plans, make better decisions and improve on-time performance.
NextGen Weather is accomplished through collaboration between FAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
