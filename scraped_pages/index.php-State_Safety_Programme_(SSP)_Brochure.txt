Description
The Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG), has published a new SSP Brochure. In the same spirit as the SM ICG 10 Things You Should Know About SMS, this two-sided, tri-fold brochure addresses basic SSP principles from ICAO Annex 19, Safety Management, SSP Standards and Recommended Practices. Topics include: why the State needs an SSP, to whom does the SSP apply, SSP framework components, SSP implementation, the relationship between SSP and SMS in practice at the State level, protection of safety data and information, and how SSP relates to global safety initiatives. The brochure also includes a short list of resources on the web.
