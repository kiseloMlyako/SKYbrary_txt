Description
The function of Aviation Topics Speech Acts Taxonomy (ATSAT) is to categorise pilot/controller voice communication to identify communication problems and develop time based performance metrics. It supports the encoding and hierarchical arrangement of operator and task performance. The encoded messages can be entered in a spreadsheet and be imported for statistical analysis.
ATSAT uses the phraseology standard contained in FAA Order 7119.65 Handbook of Air Traffic Control.
