Closed in 2016, this former international airport served Quito, the capital city of Ecuador. The airport, one of the highest in the world (at 2800 meters AMSL) is located in the northern part of the city, in the Chaupicruz parish.
Due to its location (in the middle of a city surrounded by mountains), the airport could not be expanded to accommodate any larger aircraft or an increase in air traffic. A new airport was built in the Tababela parish, about 18 km to the east of the city.
