SES Implementation



Description
The Single European Sky (SES) initiative has been put in place in 2004 by four regulations of the European Parliament and the Council which became popular under the heading "SES I legislative package" and were subsequently amended in 2009 by the "SES II legislative package". These basic regulations, aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency of air transport in Europe, lay down the framework for the creation and full implementation of the SES, notably institutional arrangements, regulatory framework, coordination bodies and mechanisms, organisation of airspace and of air navigation service provision, as well as the framework for the introduction of new agreed and validated concepts of operations and technology in European air traffic management.
