Description
Tianjin Binhai International Airport is an airport located east of Tianjin, in Dongli District.
Climatology
Tianjin features a four season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. Monthly mean temperatures range from −3.5 to 26.6 °C from January to July, with an annual average of 12.7 °C. With precipitation being generous only during the summer months, and a low annual total of 540 millimetres, the city lies within the humid continental zone, with parts of the municipality being semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSk/Dwa, respectively).
