Warbirds are ex-military aircraft that are preserved, maintained and operated by private individuals and organizations. Warbirds are a common attraction at air shows and flying displays.
The mission of the Association of Professional Warbird Operations (APWO), which is a member-based, non-profit organization, is to create and maintain the highest level of professionalism across the entire spectrum of ward operations. The organization says it uses its combined knowledge "to educate and increase the competency" of its members, thereby reducing risk and ensuring the survivability and sustainability of Warbird air crews and aircraft.
More information is available on the APWO website.
