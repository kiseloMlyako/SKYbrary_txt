What we have Experienced

Infringement of controlled airspace constitutes severe operational hazard;
Recent Safety Improvement Sub-Group (SISG) meetings have identified this hazard as one of the highest priorities for focussing the safety improvement efforts.
SISG reported on a variety of causal factors including:

Inappropriate map or inappropriate use of maps; sometimes even use of road maps and use of Global Positioning System (GPS);
Adequacy of airspace allocation - availability of airspace for General Aviation (GA) (GA);
Adequacy of airspace classification;
Adequacy of GA pilot training and awareness;
Infringements by military aircraft;
Adequacy of air-ground communications - establishing communication, discipline, procedures and phraseology;
Adverse weather conditions;


Specific concern was reported regarding:

Class “E” airspace infringement;
Difficulties in establishing interfaces to General Aviation crew for providing aeronautical information and awareness;
PPL training, licensing and proficiency maintenance.



Potential Solutions

Review and improvement of the airspace organisation - including allocation and classification;
Establishing interface with General Aviation and providing them with regular awareness packages;
EUROCONTROL has launched a study to investigate the possible carriage of SSR/Mode-S transponders by light aircraft.
