Description
Airlines for Europe (A4E) is a trade association of European airlines created in January 2016 by Europe's five largest carriers: International Airlines Group (IAG), Air France–KLM, EasyJet, Lufthansa and Ryanair. It is the first time an airlines trade association gathers full-service and low-cost carriers. In was created in response to the claimed ineffectiveness of the previous major European airlines trade association, the Association of European Airlines (AEA).
In the beginning of 2018 the association had 15 members.
A4E focuses on improving the competitiveness of the EU Aviation sector by:

lowering the cost of the EU’s Airports;
delivering reliable and efficient airspace;
removing unreasonable taxes.
