Trajectory based operations (TBO) is an air traffic management (ATM) concept intended to enhance strategic planning of aircraft flows to reduce capacity-to-demand imbalance in the airspace System and provide tools to ATM personnel and controls to expedite aircraft movement between origin and destination airports.
TBO is expected to help reduce reactive decision-making and use of static miles-in-trail restrictions through improved planning and management of traffic flows. Overall, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration expects TBO to enhance flight efficiency, increase airspace and airport throughput, and improve operational predictability flexibility. 
Aircraft trajectory is the core tentative of TBO and is defined in four dimensions – latitude, longitude, altitude and time. 
FAA has described TBO as the "ultimate goal" of its Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program to modernize the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS)
