Description
Radar Advisory Service (RAS) is a service provided within air traffic advisory airspace with the aid of radar to ensure separation, where practical, between aircraft which are operating on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plans. (EUROCONTROL EATM Glossary of Terms)
In practice, traffic information is provided on all relevant traffic, whether or not it is operating on an IFR flight plan.
RAS may provide the following information to identified aircraft:
a) information regarding any aircraft observed to be on a conflicting path with the radar-identified aircraft and suggestions or advice regarding avoiding action;
b) information on the position of significant weather and, as practicable, advice to the aircraft on how best to circumnavigate any such areas of adverse weather
c) information to assist the aircraft in its navigation.
RAS is not available outside advisory airspace.
