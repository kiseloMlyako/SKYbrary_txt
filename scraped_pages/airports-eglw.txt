Description
London Heliport, previously called Battersea Heliport is located on the south bank of the River Thames at Battersea, 3 nm southwest of Westminster Bridge and between Wandsworth Bridge and Battersea Railway Bridge. NOTE that it is open only when it is believed that SVFR minima prevail. However, since this determination is based on the METARs at EGLL, SVFR conditions may not actually exist even if the heliport is notified as 'open'.
Climatology
Temperate Marine climate/Oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). Moderately cool summer and comparatively warm winter with a temperature range of only 14°C. Prevailing south-westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean.
