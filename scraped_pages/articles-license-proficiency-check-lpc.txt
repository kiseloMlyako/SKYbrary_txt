A license proficiency check (LPC) entails demonstrating the skills necessary to revalidate or renew a pilot's ratings or priveleges. LPCs may involve both ground training and flight simulator elements.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) defines the term "proficiency check" as "the demonstration of skill to revalidate or renew ratings, and including such oral examination as may be required.”
