Definition
The reporting metadata specification is the list of mandatory fields which have to be provided to ICAO in the context of accident data reporting (ADREP). Metadata is data about accident data, allowing classification and categorisation for safety analysis purposes.
Metadata specification
The table below lists the data ICAO requires Member States to include as a minimum into the data report as per Chapter 7 of ICAO Annex 13. Highlighted fields are used to uniquely identify the report in the ICAO database. Notifications which do not contain this information will be rejected.
A subset of this data may already be available right after that the event occurred and should therefor be communicated in the initial notification sent to ICAO as per Chapter 4 of ICAO Annex 13.
