Description
Aviation regulator workforces include highly skilled positions with significant technical and educational requirements. As Safety Management System (SMS) implementation progresses, it will become necessary for regulators to define SMS-related competencies for their inspector workforce, which will ensure that personnel requirements are aligned with the SMS and employees have the requisite skills and knowledge to perform SMS oversight effectively.
This document provides core SMS competencies for inspectors tasked with accomplishing oversight activities, as recommended by the Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG) and the guidance used to develop these competencies and behaviors that demonstrate proficiency. It does not establish metrics for performance standards. Although this document only provides competencies for inspectors, the framework provided can be used to develop other position competencies as needed by a regulator.
Although this document focuses on competencies related to SMS, regulators should also consider how these competencies fit into their overall authority level competencies. It is not recommended or intended for regulators to have multiple sets of competencies that could be inconsistent or divergent from each other.
