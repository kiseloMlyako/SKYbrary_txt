Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce runway excursion accidents. Air Carriers should define, publish, and train proper techniques for stabilized approach, flare, touchdown, and use of available airplane stopping devices for the following scenarios:
1. Landing with reduced or minimal landing distance margin resulting from one or more of:
a. Wet or contaminated conditions
b. Tailwind, including gusts
c. Runway closures that reduce available landing distance
2. Landing with conditions conducive to directional control issues, resulting from one or more of:
a. Crosswind, including gusts
b. System failures (thrust, brakes, nose gearing steering, etc.) or Minimum Equipment List (MEL) conditions that results in directional asymmetries
