Background
This safety enhancement tasks the Director of Safety (DOS) with establishing a process to identify, review, analyze, and include appropriate safety information in training programs and manuals used by flightcrews and maintenance staff.
Related Implementation Plan
Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
CAST endorsed the Handbook Bulletin Air Transportation—Policy Company Operating Manuals and Company Training Program Revisions for Compliance with Current Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual Revisions (HBAT 99-07). Senior management asked the DOS to apply the principals of HBAT 99-07 to training programs and manuals used by flightcrews and maintenance staff. The HBAT has since been cancelled and the guidance incorporated into FAA Order 8900.1 available on FAA's  Dynamic Regulatory System, but is included here for the information it contains.
The following safety culture guidance materials are endorsed by CAST: SAE G18 Committee's "Operator’s Aviation Safety Handbook" and the FAA Audit Tool.
