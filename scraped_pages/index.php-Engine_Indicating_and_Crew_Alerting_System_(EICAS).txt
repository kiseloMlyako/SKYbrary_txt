Definition
Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) is defined as is an aircraft system for displaying engine parameters and alerting crew to system configuration or faults.
Description
EICAS systems are found on Boeing, Embraer and many other aircraft types. An EICAS system will display engine parameters and, depending upon manufacturer and model, may display other information such as fuel quantity, cabin pressure or landing gear and flap/slat position. It will also alert the crew to aircraft configuration issues such as open passenger or cargo doors and will, in conjunction with a Master Warning or Master Caution light and aural alert, indicate system faults and failures by displaying the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist title of the appropriate remedial action. An examples of an EICAS display is shown below.
