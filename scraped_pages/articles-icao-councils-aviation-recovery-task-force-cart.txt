Description
The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Council’s Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) was established shortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020.
The pandemic has had a dramatic impact on air travel and the aviation industry. During the depths of the pandemic, operational levels were a small fraction of pre-pandemic levels.
CART is strategically focused work group convened by the ICAO Council to anticipate challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is intended to “provide practical, aligned guidance to industry operators in order to restart the international air transport sector and recover from the impacts of COVID-19 on a coordinated global basis,” according to ICAO.
Recommendations and guidelines issued by CART are continuously reviewed and updated based on the latest medal and operational advice. ICAO says that material issued by CART is intended to harmonize – not replace – the COVID-19 roadmaps established by states, regions and industry groups, ICAO said.
