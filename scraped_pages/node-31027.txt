Definition
Climate encompasses the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elemental measurements in a given region over long periods.
Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.
Regional Climate
The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme, and that used throughout SKYbrary, was originally developed by Wladimir Köppen - the Köppen Climate Classification (KCC) .
Airport articles on SKYbrary include a brief summary of the climatology.
Certain regions of the world are known to present particular climatic challenges to aviation operations. SKYbrary contains a number of specific articles which summarise the climate of a region and the weather related safety threats to aviation:

Newfoundland
Caribbean

Climatic Phenomena
SKYbrary contains articles on specific climatic phenomena which influence the global climate, for example El Nino, or which have a particular impact on the conduct of air operations across large parts of the globe, for example the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone.
