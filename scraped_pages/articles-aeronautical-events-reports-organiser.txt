Definition
Aeronautical Events Reports Organiser - AERO is a Safety Report Management and Analysis System.
 
Description
The aim of AERO is to organise and manage incidents and irregularities in a reporting system, to provide graphs and reports, and to share information with other users. AERO is a FileMaker database developed to support the management of the safety department of aviation operators. AERO was created to enhance communication between the safety department and all employees, reduce paper handling, and produce reports. The Data Sharing program allows all AERO Certified Users to benefit from the experience of the other users. AERO users review their monthly events and decide which ones to share with the rest of the companies using AERO.
