The General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark is a medium-range interdictor and tactical strike aircraft that also fills the roles of strategic bomber, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare in its various versions. Developed in the 1960s and first entering service in 1967, the United States Air Force (USAF) variants were officially retired by 1998 and replaced by the F-15E Strike Eagle. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the sole remaining operator of the F-111.
