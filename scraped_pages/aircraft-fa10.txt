The Dassault Myst√®re/Falcon 10 is an early corporate jet development by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. Despite its numbering sequence it was actually developed after the Falcon 20, and is basically a scaled down version of that aircraft. Production began in 1971 and ceased in 1989 but it remains a popular business jet on the used market.
