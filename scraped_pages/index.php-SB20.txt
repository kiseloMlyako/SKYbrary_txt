Turboprop regional airliner. In service since 1994. Stretched, more powerful development of SAAB 340 regional airliner. First civil aircraft powered by Allison AE-2100A turboprops (developed for the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor). Cabin noise is reduced by an active noise control system with 72 microphones and 36 speakers which generate an anti-phase noise. 56 aircraft were built until 1998 and production then ceased.
