Description
QUORUM Perilog refers to four data mining methods together, which are comprised of keyword-in-context search, phrase search, phrase generation, and phrase discovery. QUORUM Perilog methods and tools enable exploratory analysis of large collections of aerospace incident narratives. QUORUM Perilog (also known as Perilog) exploits the situational structure of “unstructured” narrative incident reports. By modelling the contextual structures of incident narratives, it models the structures of the incidents themselves. This makes it possible to explore narrative databases.
QUORUM Perilog has developed by NASA. Perilog was originally designed to support the FAA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System (Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)).
