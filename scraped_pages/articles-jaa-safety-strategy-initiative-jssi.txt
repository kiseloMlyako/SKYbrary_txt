JAA Safety Strategy Initiative (JSSI)
The JAA Safety Strategy Initiative (JSSI), was launched in 1998, and was a safety improvement program supporting the JAA in meeting their overall objective to continually improve safety in Europe in particular and worldwide in general.
Because of the transition from JAA to EASA for all EU and certain associated States, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had established European Strategic Safety Initiative the European Strategic Safety Initiative which had taken over from JSSI and later closed in 2016.
The foundation meeting of ESSI took place on April 28, 2006 and the last meeting of the JSSI Steering Group was held on 28 June 2006.
