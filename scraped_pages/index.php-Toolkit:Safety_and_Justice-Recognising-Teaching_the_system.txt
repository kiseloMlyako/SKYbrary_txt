Teaching the system











  Teaching the system











Operators in the field often walk around with their "little black book" in the pocket of their coveralls. This little black book is a notebook in which they keep their personal notes about what to do but also, very often, how to do certain things. These are often little gems of knowledge but, on the other hand, can also sometimes lead to problems. An operator may have notes about "how to operate a certain system" in his black book, but when the system changes without him knowing these outdated personal instructions may lead to risks.
One day, it came to our notice that one particular operator had particularly intricate notes. It turned out that he had a real talent for understanding how a system worked, and for making diagrams that easily explained to an operator how a system worked, what the safest way of operating was. His schemes were much better, and much more appropriate for operators than all the other drawings around. These schemes were reviewed by the engineering team, given an official status, and have now been put together into the "Operators Almanac" which now is carried by the operators... in the same pocket as their little black book!
