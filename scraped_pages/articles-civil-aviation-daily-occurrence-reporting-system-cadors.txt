Description
Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System (CADORS) is the name given to the Canadian national ATS safety data reporting system which collects information about operational occurrences within the Canadian National Civil Air Transportation System. It is used to assist the early identification of potential aviation hazards and system deficiencies. Under the Canadian Aeronautics Act, there is a mandatory requirement for ATS certificate holders to report items listed in the CADORS Manual. CADORS reports are collected from a number of sources. The main information provider is ANSP NAV CANADA, which supplies close to 80% of all reports. Other information providers include the Transportation Safety Board, airports, police forces, public, etc.
CADORS captures a wide scope of safety related events including:

ATC operating irregularities
Communication, navigation, surveillance, and other air traffic systems failures
Controlled airspace violations
etc.

Included in the collection are occurrences related to aircraft, aerodromes, security (e.g. bomb threats, strike actions) and environment (e.g. fuel spills)
CADORS was launched in 1985 and has a database of more than 300,000 reports by 2023.
