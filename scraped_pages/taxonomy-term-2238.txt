Ground Operations









Description
Ground Operations involves all aspects of aircraft handling at the airport, as well as aircraft movement around the aerodrome except on active runways. The safety challenges of ground operations are partly associated directly with those operations; for example, ensuring that aircraft are not involved in collisions and that the jet efflux from large aircraft does not endanger small ones. Even more important, ground operations are about preparing aircraft for departure in such a way that the subsequent flight will be safe; for example, correct loading of cargo and baggage, sufficient and verified fuel of adequate quantity and quality and the correct use of ground deicing and anti-icing facilities, where appropriate.
For further, general information about the safety challenges associated with ground operaitons read the entry article Ground Operations.
