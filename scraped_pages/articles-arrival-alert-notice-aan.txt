Description
Arrival Alert Notices (AAN) are graphics produced by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that visually depict an approach at specific airports to help mitigate wrong surface misalignment risks for pilots. The AAN includes language describing the misalignment risk. FAA is producing the AANs to address the issue of wrong surface events and to reduce the potential for pilot confusion. Wrong surface events include events where an aircraft lines up to or lands on the incorrect runway, taxiway or airport.
