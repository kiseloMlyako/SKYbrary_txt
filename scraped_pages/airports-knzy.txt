Description
Naval Air Station North Island, or NAS North Island, is located at the north end of the Coronado peninsula on San Diego Bay in San Diego, California. It is the home port to the aircraft compliment of several aircraft carriers of the United States Navy.
Climatology
Semi-arid or Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification BSh or Csa/Csb). It enjoys mild, sunny weather throughout the year. Since the San Diego area straddles areas of Mediterranean climate (Csa) to the north, and Semi-arid climate (BSh) to the south and east, the climate is often referred to as "Mediterranean" or "arid-mediterranean". Fog is common in May and June.
