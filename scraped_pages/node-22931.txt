Definition
In aviation, decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from multiple alternatives.
Description
Decision-making generally has four components:

Defining the problem
Considering the options
Selecting and implementing an option
Reviewing the outcome.

Decision making is influenced by:

Situational Awareness - a combination of availability of information and the ability of the decision maker to interpret the information (skills and professional knowledge)
Experience - familiarity with similar, perhaps routine, situations.
Social - social pressure, national and institutional culture.
Situational limitations - Physiological & psychological pressures (stress, fatigue, hypoxia etc), time pressure
