Description
On 5 October 2007, a loss of separation occurred between a Hughes 369 helicopter and a Jodel D150. The incident occurred outside controlled airspace, in VMC, and the estimated vertical separation as the Jodel took avoiding action by descending, was assessed by both pilots to be less than 50 feet.
The helicopter pilot's workload at the time of the incident was high as a result of frequency and transponder changes, and he did not notice the Jodel until it passed under his aircraft.
