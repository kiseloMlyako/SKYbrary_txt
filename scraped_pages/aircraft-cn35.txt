The CASA/IPTN CN-235 is a medium-range twin-engined transport plane that was jointly developed by CASA of Spain and IPTN of Indonesia as a regional airliner and military transport. Its primary military roles include maritime patrol, surveillance, and air transport. The project was a joint venture between CASA and Indonesian manufacturer IPTN, which formed Airtech company to manage the programme. The partnership applied only to the Series 10 and Series 100/110, with later versions being developed independently. Over 230 of all versions of CN-235 are in service. In 1995, CASA launched development of a stretched CN-235 as the C-295.
