Description
The Surface Awareness Initiative (SAI) system uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) data to display surface traffic to air traffic controllers at airports that do not have a surface surveillance tool. Aircraft and ADS-B-equipped vehicles appear as icons on an airport map that depicts runways, taxiways, hold ramps and other areas. SAI is intended to reduce the risk of runway incursions by improving air traffic controllers’ situational awareness. 
SAI is one of three tools that comprise the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) surface safety portfolio. The other tools are Approach Runway Verification (ARV) and the Runway Incursion Device (RID).
