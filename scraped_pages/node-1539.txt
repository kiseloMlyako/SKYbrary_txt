PIREP
Description
A Pilot Report or PIREP is a report of the actual weather conditions as encountered by an aircraft in flight. Traditionally, these reports are transmitted by radio to an appropriate ground station for dissemination but, when necessary, they can be made by telephone after landing. More recently, appropriately equipped aircraft can automatically send meteorological reports using the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) programme.
The Need
Hazardous weather exists in many forms inclusive of turbulence, in-flight icing and thunderstorms. Pilots encountering any of these phenomena can contribute to the safety of flight for other aircraft by reporting the time, location and intensity of the encountered threat.
The Process
PIREPs are encouraged in virtually all airspace. In some parts of the world, air traffic facilities are required to solicit PIREPs when any of the following conditions are reported or forecast:

ceilings at or below 5,000 feet
visibility at or below 5 miles (surface or aloft)
thunderstorms and related phenomena
icing of light degree or greater
turbulence of moderate degree or greater
wind shear
reported or forecast volcanic ash cloud

Pilots are urged to cooperate and promptly volunteer reports of these conditions and other atmospheric data such as: 

cloud bases, tops and layers
flight visibility
precipitation
visibility restrictions such as haze, smoke and dust
wind at altitude
temperature aloft

The ground station receiving the Pilot Report will format and disseminate the information to all concerned parties. Beyond advising other aircraft in the immediate area of the hazard, the PIREP is used:

by ATS for hazardous weather avoidance procedures
by the flight service centres to brief other pilots, to provide inflight advisories, and weather avoidance information to enroute aircraft
by the area control centre to expedite the flow of enroute traffic, to determine most favorable altitudes, and to issue hazardous weather information within the center’s area
by the national weather service to verify or amend the aviation forecast. In some cases, pilot reports of hazardous conditions are the triggering mechanism for the issuance of advisories
by the national weather service, other government organizations, the military, and private industry groups for research activities in the study of meteorological phenomena

The Report
When providing a PIREP, the pilot should strive to be as accurate as possible. Mandatory information includes the location (normally reference a navigation aid or fix, the time, the altitude and the aircraft type followed by a description of the hazard. When describing the intensity of icing or turbulence, the pilot should use the standard definitions as per the National Aviation Authority (NAA) AIPs or other appropriate publication. The ground station receiving the PIREP will then code the information in a standardised format for dissemination.
The PIREP Code Chart
A Pilot Report is coded for transmission in accordance with the following table.
