Description
Electrical power is supplied to the various electrically energised components in an aircraft via common points called bus-bars or busses. The electrical power distribution system is based on one or more busses, the number of which varies as a function of the size and the complexity of the aircraft. Bus naming convention varies by manufacturer but names such as Essential AC Bus, Left DC Bus and Battery Bus are commonly used to denote importance, power source and voltage.
