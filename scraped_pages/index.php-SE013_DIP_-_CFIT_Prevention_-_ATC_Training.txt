Implementation Plan for ATC Training - CFIT Prevention
Statement of Work: (SE-13)
Training procedures are presently in effect, re-emphasis to current procedures and or slight modifications to current procedures could be acted upon almost immediately.
Outcomes
To improve aviation safety by reinforcing current safety alert procedures and good Air Traffic operating practices.
Outputs
Publish an Air Traffic Bulletin (ATB) article (Appendix A). A verbal briefing will be given to all enroute and terminal Air Traffic Controllers on the history of the Commercial Aviation Safety Team and handbook paragraphs to review.
Relationship to Current Aviation Community Initiatives
Flight Safety Foundation has published an article on ATC communications. It does not specifically address this issue, and it is a related topic.
Performance Goals & Indicators for Outcomes/Outputs

Goal: Provide consistent issuance of Safety Alerts.
Goal: Provide quality On The Job Training (OJT) while not impacting the safety of the flying public.
Indicators: Initial Action: The use of Air Traffic Bulletins have been proven to be a reliable method to raise awarness of critical rules and regulations. :*Followup Action: Use of safety alerts is covered yearly in refresher training and OJT operating practices are covered during facility evaluations, if improvement is needed follow-up action and management controls are required.
Goal: Increase the awareness of flight crew workload during departure/landing by using FMS fixes and precision approaches.
Indicators: User comments and a reduction in CFIT Accidents.

Lead Organization for Coordination
Air Traffic Operations (ATO-100)
Programmatic Approach
A review of the current regulations and orders was conducted. All of the initiatives were covered in current regulations and orders. It was determined that the best way to reinforce and review the orders was an Air Traffic Bulletin. This vehicle requires that every person controlling air traffic be verbally briefed on the content of the ATB.

“Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) Avoidance”
/*ET/ During the fall of 1997, the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), a combined organization of the FAA, NASA, ALPA, ATA and airplane and engine manufactures dedicated to working together to improve aviation safety, chartered a team to look at CFIT accidents. Strategies and interventions to minimize the occurrence of CFIT were developed. The results were 9 project areas; one of them is Air Traffic control.
This will provide a review of the current handbook paragraphs associated with: Assisting Flight Crews with Situation Awareness, Safety Alerts, Minimum Safe Altitude Alerts, and On-the Job Training.
We need to emphasize the controller’s responsibility to assist the flight crew in situation awareness. FAAO 7110.65 Paragraph 5-1-10 States: “Inform an aircraft when it is observed in a position and on a track which will obviously cause the aircraft to deviate from its protected airspace area. If necessary, assist the aircraft to return to the assigned protected airspace. Paragraph 2-1-6 States: Issue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is in a position/attitude which, in your judgement, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. Once the pilot informs you action is being taken to resolve the situation, you may discontinue the issuance of further alerts. Do not assume that because someone else has responsibility for the aircraft that the unsafe situation has been observed and the safety alert issued; inform the appropriate controller. Terrain/Obstruction Alert – Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is at an altitude which, in your judgement, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain / obstructions. Issue the alert as follows: (identification) LOW ALTITUDE ALERT, CHECK YOUR ALTITUDE IMMEDIATELY, THE (as appropriate) MEA/MVA/MOCA/MIA IN YOUR AREA IS (altitude)…
The issuance of a safety alert is a first priority, recognition of situations of unsafe proximity may result from MSAW/E-MSAW/LAAS, Mode C, Conflict / Mode C intruder alert, or pilot report. Once the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot’s prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will be taken.
With more aircraft equipped with Flight Management Systems, we need to use all available tools to establish aircraft position, don’t fixate on just DME. FAAO 7110.65 Paragraph 2-5-3 States: Describe fixes determined by reference to a radial/localizer/azimuth and distance from a VOR / DME / VORTAC / TACAN / ILS-DME or MLS as follows: a. When a fix is not named, state the name of the NAVAID followed by a specified radial / localizer / azimuth, and state the distance in miles followed by the phrase “mile fix”. b. When a fix is charted on a SID, STAR, Enroute chart, or approach plate, state the name of the fix. c. Use specific terms to describe a fix. Do not use expressions such as “passing Victor Twelve” or passing J Eleven.”
A recurring pattern in the reviewed accidents was the need for stabilized vertical guidance approaches. When available and practical clear aircraft for approaches with vertical guidance (ILS). FAAO 7110.65 Paragraph 4-8-1 States: Clear aircraft for “standard” or “special” instrument approach procedures only…An aircraft conducting an ILS/MLS approach when the glideslope/ glidepath is reported out of service shall be advised at the time an approach clearance is issued. SIAP’s shall commence at an initial approach fix or an intermediate approach fix if there is not an initial approach fix. Where adequate radar coverage exists, radar facilities may vector aircraft to the final approach course in accordance with paragraph 5-9-1. Except for vectors for visual approach, vectoring arriving aircraft tot intercept the final approach course: a. At least 2 miles outside the approach gate unless of the following exists: 1. When the report ceiling is at least 500’ above the MVA/MIA and the visibility is at least 3 miles, aircraft may be vectored closer than 21 miles outside the approach gate but no closer than the final approach fix. 2. If specifically requested by the pilot, aircraft may be vectored to intercept the final approach course inside the approach gate but no closer than the final approach fix. b. For a precision approach, at an altitude not above the glideslope/glidepath or below the minimum glideslope intercept altitude specified on the APC. c. For nonprecision approach, at an altitude which will allow descent in accordance with the published procedure.
In some of the accidents reviewed, On the Job Training (OJT)was being conducted and may have contributed to the accident. All OJT Instructors’s are reminded to maintain control and vigilance on the position.
In some cases non-rated controllers were operating a position unsupervised. FAA Order 7220.1 Paragraph 50 b. states: The individual may perform duties as a controller only at those sectors or positions at which they are qualified; otherwise, they are in training under the direct supervision of a controller qualified at the position being worked.
If you have questions or require further assistance, please contact Ardyth Williams at extension 78364.

Once the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot’s prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will be taken.
FAAO 3120.4 is our Air Traffic Technical Training Order. 2-12 addresses Refresher Training. (b)(1)(a) states: Refresher Training shall include unusual situations, such as weather affecting flight, aircraft equipment failure and other types of emergencies. (c) includes Safety alerts and traffic advisories. (4) states: Operational personnel shall receive the following training in lost aircraft orientation annually. A combination of this annual refresher training and a possible article in the Air Traffic Bulletin should provide the needed emphasis.

10 Rating – 2 Some development required, not currently in public use

FAAO 7110.65 Paragraph 2-5-3 States: Describe fixes determined by reference to a radial/localizer/azimuth and distance from a VOR / DME / VORTAC / TACAN / ILS-DME or MLS as follows: d. When a fix is not named, state the name of the NAVAID followed by a specified radial / localizer / azimuth, and state the distance in miles followed by the phrase “mile fix”. e. When a fix is charted on a SID, STAR, Enroute chart , or approach plate, state the name of the fix. f. Use specific terms to describe a fix. Do not use expressions such as “passing Victor Twelve” or passing J Eleven.”
FAAO 3120.4 is our Air Traffic Technical Training Order. 2-12 addresses Refresher Training. (h) is “other topics identified and transmitted by Air Traffic and Regional Offices”. A combination of this annual refresher training and a possible article in the Air Traffic Bulletin should provide the needed emphasis.

13 Rating – 2 Some development required, not currently in public use

FAAO 7110.65 Paragraph 4-8-1 States: Clear aircraft for “standard” or “special” instrument approach procedures only…An aircraft conducting an ILS/MLS approach when the glideslope/ glidepath is reported out of service shall be advised at the time an approach clearance is issued.

FAAO 3120.4 is our Air Traffic Technical Training Order. 2-12 addresses Refresher Training. (h) is “other topics identified and transmitted by Air Traffic and Regional Offices”. An Air Traffic Bulletin or (h) in the 3120.4 are two options to emphasize this intervention.

108 Rating – 3 Off the shelf technology, no development required

Before a person may conduct OJT, they must have: a. certified for 6 months on the position b. current on the position c. recommended by the supervisor
Then a panel composed of a minimum of 2 people will consider the following attributes before it’s recommendation of the OJTI’s: a. Human relations skills b. Communications skills c. Motivation and attitude d. Objectivity e. Credibility
Then the names are forwarded to the Air Traffic Manager. The selecties then must successfully complete the approved FAA Air Traffic OJTI course. During this course, the students are briefed on the basics of instruction including the hazards of being in an instruction situation with live traffic. To ensure that the OJTI’s are performing to standards, the first line supervisor will give all OJTI’s an over the shoulder evaluation every 6 months while they are performing OJTI duties.
The regulations / evaluations are in place. This item could be included in an Air Traffic Bulletin addressing this whole issue.

11 Rating – 3 Off the shelf technology, no development required

FAA Order 7220.1 Paragraph 50 b. states: The individual may perform duties as a controller only at those sectors or positions at which they are qualified; otherwise, they are in training under the direct supervision of a controller qualified at the position being worked.
