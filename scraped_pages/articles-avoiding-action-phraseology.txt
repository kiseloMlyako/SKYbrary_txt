What we Experienced

EUROCONTROL SISG discussions reconfirmed again, and from recent safety occurrences it was found that the correct Avoiding Action Phraseology has not been effectively used, and/or it has not been used where it would have been appropriate to;


The BFU Uberlingen Investigation Report emphasised the importance of the proper use of avoiding action phraseology.

ICAO Procedure

Please note the following phraseology contained in ICAO PANS ATM - provisions for Radar Phraseology - 12.4.1.8 TRAFFIC INFORMATION AND AVOIDING ACTION:

e) "TURN LEFT (or RIGHT) IMMEDIATELY HEADING (three digits) TO AVOID [UNIDENTIFIED] TRAFFIC (bearing by clock-reference and distance)"; or,
f) "TURN LEFT (or RIGHT) (number of degrees) DEGREES IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID [UNIDENTIFIED] TRAFFIC AT (bearing by clock-reference and distance)".
Please, note that ICAO provides two formats for an avoiding action message, both specifying a manoeuvre in the horizontal plane.
