Definition
Alpha Range - in a turboprop engine, is the range of power lever positions between flight idle and maximum power.
Description
The alpha range is used from takeoff through landing. The constant speed propeller is controlled by the propeller governor to maintain the selected RPM. The power lever controls fuel only and is not directly linked to the propeller blade angle.
