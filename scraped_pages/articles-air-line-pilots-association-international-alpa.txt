Description
The Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), is a U.S.-based trade union that represents more than 77,000 professional pilots at 43 U.S and Canadian airlines. The organization was founded in 1931 and is the self-described largest airline pilot union in the world. ALPA says the three critical services it provides to its members are airline safety, security and pilot assistance; representation; and advocacy.
Mission Statement
ALPA's mission is to promote and champion all aspects of aviation safety throughout all segments of the aviation community; to represent, in both specific and general respects, the collective interests of all pilots in commercial aviation; to assist in collective bargaining activities on behalf of all pilots represented by the Association; to promote the health and welfare of the members of the Association before all governmental agencies; to be a strong, forceful advocate of the airline piloting profession, through all forms of media, and with the public at large; and to be the ultimate guardian and defender of the rights and privileges of the professional pilots who are members of the Association.
