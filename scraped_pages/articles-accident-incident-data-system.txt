Accident Incident Data System
Description
The FAA Accident/Incident Data System (AIDS) database contains incident data records for all categories of civil aviation in the US. Incidents are events that do not meet the aircraft damage or personal injury thresholds contained in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) definition of an accident. The FAA AIDS database contains incidents that occurred between 1978 and the present. The information contained in AIDS is gathered from several sources including incident reports on FAA Form 8020-5. The data are presented in a report format divided into the following categories: Location Information, Aircraft Information, Operator Information, Narrative, Findings, Weather/Environmental Information, and Pilot Information and other data fields.
