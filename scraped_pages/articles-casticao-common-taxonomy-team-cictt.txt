Description
The CAST/ICAO Common Taxonomy Team (CICTT) was established in 1999 by the U.S. Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to develop and promote common terminology, definitions used to describe aviation safety events. The intent was to remove constraints on aviation safety analysis and sharing. In addition, emerging safety hazards associated with new technologies and aircraft were often not accommodated by existing taxonomies. The the lack of standard international event descriptors and data standard among or within aviation organizations can result in information quality and use problems that diminish the value of safety information and data.
