Description
Scheduled time of departure (STD) is a term that is normally not used in an operational environment. It is mostly of interest to passengers. When this information is presented on a public display (e.g. at an airport's terminal), local time (either standard or summer) is to be used in a 24-hour format. In case of any deviation from the STD, the relevant information is displayed either in the Remarks column, or in a dedicated column named "Estimated time".
