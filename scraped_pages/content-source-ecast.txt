European Commercial Aviation Safety Team (ECAST)
Launched in October 2006, ECAST was the European equivalent of Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) in the US. In March 2016, the initiative was discontinued and ECAST functions and resources were transferred to the other teams involved in the European Safety Risk Management (SRM) system.
