SAM Toolkit
The EUROCONTROL Safety Assessment Methodology (SAM) is a framework, a toolbox containing methods and techniques to carry out safety assessment of changes to the functional systems of the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP). It was developed in the noughties of the 21st century as means of compliance to ESSAR 4. 
The objective of the methodology is to support the provision of assurance of the safety of the Air Traffic Services (ATS) provided by an ANSP. It covers the entire system/change life cycle: specification, design, implementation, integration, transfer into operation and operation and maintenance. The assessment process includes Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA), Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA) and a System Safety Assessment (SSA). 
SAM is organised in three levels: level 1 explains the "what", level 2 provides details on "how" to perform a safety assessment and level 3 provides real life examples from ANSPs and the industry.
Although there have been many changes in the regulatory framework in Europe and elsewhere, SAM is still relevant and can be used for risk assessment and mitigation purposes.
