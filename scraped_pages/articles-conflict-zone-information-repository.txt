Description
The Conflict Zone Information Repository was an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) sponsored website, the purpose of which was to "... compile in a centralized and recognized location certain information promulgated by States regarding risks to civil aircraft arising from conflict zones". The information on this site was restricted to submissions from ICAO authorized users and was based on publicly available sources such as Notice To Airmen or Aeronautical Information Circular information.
This interim website tool was launched by ICAO on 2 April 2015, to disseminate risk intelligence. By January 2017, survey data showed that voluntary participation in CZIR had declined significantly and that many stakeholders had chosen alternate proprietary systems of real-time sharing. In December 2017, ICAO decided to close the CZIR and a temporary derivative web-library to concentrate on other priorities.
