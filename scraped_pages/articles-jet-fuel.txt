Jet fuel is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. It is clear to straw-colored in appearance. The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1 which are produced to a standardised international specification. The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is Jet B which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance.
Jet fuel is similar to kerosene, and has a much higher flash-point than gasoline (e.g. AVGAS) used in piston-engine aircraft. This is an important safety feature, in that the risk of fire in general use, and especially following an accident, is much lower for turbo-jet aircraft.
