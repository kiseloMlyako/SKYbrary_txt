A turbine-conversion of the DHC-2, the Turbo Beaver (DHC-2T) first flew in December 1963. This version featured a Pratt & Whitney PT6A6 turboprop, which offered lower empty and higher take-off weights, and even better Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) performance. The Turbo Beaver's cabin was also longer, allowing maximum accommodation for 11, including the pilot. Externally, the Turbo Beaver had a much longer and re-profiled nose, and squared off vertical tail.
