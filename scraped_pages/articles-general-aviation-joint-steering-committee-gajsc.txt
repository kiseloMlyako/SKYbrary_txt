Background
The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) was launched in 1997 as part of the industry-government Safer Skies Initiative to improve aviation safety. It is a public-private partnership and was revitalized in 2011. Its stated goal is to improve general aviation safety through data-driven risk reduction efforts focused on education, training and enabling new equipment in GA aircraft.
The GAJSC analyzes aviation safety data to identify emerging issues and develop mitigation strategies to address and prioritize safety issues. GAJSC participants include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and industry stakeholders, including pilot organizations, flight instructors, mechanics, builders, and manufacturers.
