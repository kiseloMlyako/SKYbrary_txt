Description
Oakland International Airport, also known as Metropolitan Oakland International Airport, is a public airport located 7.4 km south of the central business district of Oakland, a city in Alameda County, California.
Climatology
Dry-summer subtropical ”Mediterranean" climate (Köppen climate classification Csb) - characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall, which is the warmest time of the year.
