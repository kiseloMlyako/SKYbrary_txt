Description
Minuano is a cold southwesterly wind that blows in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul and in Uruguay. It has the same name of the indigenous Minuane people in the Portuguese language (in Spanish, the name of that people is Minuán, and the same wind is called pampero in Uruguay). It is widely mentioned in the Gaúcho folklore of the region. This wind originates from cold polar fronts that come from the southwest of South America during periods of high atmospheric pressure, usually following rains caused by the shock of the cold front with warmer stationary humid air. Sometimes it produces a "howling" sound.
