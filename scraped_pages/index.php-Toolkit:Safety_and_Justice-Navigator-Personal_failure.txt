Welcome
Theory













No laughing matter! You thought the person was in the wrong here. The rules were clear, and he/she decided otherwise. But why? Could the work maybe not be done by applying the rules? Or was it better for the company to do it like that? Showing off to a colleague or superior perhaps? Or because it looked real nice.
Even worse are cases where people were just doing things because they thought to do it like they did. Personal gain. Going home early. Or just for kicks? Good luck with your last selection...



 

 


 

 


 

 



 













How to use the navigator
This is a general purpose navigator that has been inspired on a combination of theoretical models. Our purpose is to give you a quick method to get to a broad interpretation of observed behaviour. From there, you can go into more detail by delving into established safety culture models for further analysis and for appropriate remedies.
This "navigator" module will take you through a set of structured questions.
Select the most appropriate answer. You will get a chance to compare your outcome with examples from your own and possibly other industries, allowing you to 'calibrate' your thinking and opinion about the action during the safety event.
You can use the up arrow  to go back to the previous step in the decision tree.
You can use the  next arrow to see what follow-up and consequences for the person in question could apply.
The following diagram explains the complete structure of the decision flow chart (click on picture for full image in new window). Handy if you want to have the complete overview.
