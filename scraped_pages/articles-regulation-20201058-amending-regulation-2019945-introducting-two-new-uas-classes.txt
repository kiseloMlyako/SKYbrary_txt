COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2020/1058 of 27 April 2020 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 as regards the introduction of two new unmanned aircraft systems classes - text published in the Official Journal of the European Union
Objective
To amend Regulation 2019/945 by introducting two new UAS classes (C05 and C06) for operations in the "specific" category as defined by Regulation 2019/947.
Summary
The main changes are summarized in the bullet points below:

Added 3 new definitions
Extended some provisions to cover operation in the ‘specific’ category under operational declaration as well as UAS fitted with the accessories kits
Removed references to deleted provisions in Regulation 765/2008 (laying down rules on conformity assessment and the general principles of the CE marking)
UAS operated in the "specific" category must have a unique serial number, unless they are:

subject to registration in accordance with Regulation 2019/947, or
privately built.


UAS intended to be operated in the "specific" category at a height below 120 meters must be equipped with a remote identification system meeting specified criteria.
Updated provisions for C1, C2 and C3 classes, the main changes being:

the direct periodic broadcast from the UA must also include an indication of the emergency status of the UAS.
the manufacturer must provide the procedures to upload the UAS operator registration number into the remote identification system as part of the UA characteristics
added requirements network remote identification system (in case the UAS is equipped with such a system)


updated the maximum sound power level per class of UA:

The requirements for the C1 class are the same regardless of MTOM (i.e. are also applicable if the MTOM is less than 250 g).
The requirements for the C2 class are the same as those for C1 if the MTOM is less than 900 g.


Definned two new classes: C5 and C6. The requriements for these classes are derived from those applicable to C3. See next subsections for details.

Class C5
Pursuant to Regulation 2019/947, flights under Standard scenario STS-01 (VLOS over a controlled ground area in a populated environment) must be conducted with a class C5 UAS.
A class C5 UAS may consist of a class C3 UAS fitted with an accessories kit that ensures the conversion into class C5.
A class 5 UAS must comply with most of the requirements of class C3, except those regarding 

the maximum attainable height 
the mandatory presence of a geo-awareness function (note: if a geo-awareness function is present, the requirements for class C3 apply).

In addition, it must comply with the following:

during flight, provide height information;
the manufacturer's instructions must include a description of the means to terminate the flight
unless tethered, tha UAS must:

not be fixed-wing
provide means for the remote pilot to terminate the flight
be equipped with a low-speed mode
provide means to continuously monitor the quality of the command and control link and receive an alert when it is likely that the link is going to be lost or degraded



Class C6
Pursuant to Regulation 2019/947, flights under Standard scenario STS-02 (BVLOS with Airspace Observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment) must be conducted with a class C6 UAS.
A class 5 UAS must comply with most of the requirements of class C3, except those regarding 

the maximum attainable height 
the power source (it is not mandatory to be powered by electricity)
the mandatory presence of a geo-awareness function (note: if a geo-awareness function is present, the requirements for class C3 apply).

In addition, it must comply with the following:

the ground speed must be limited to 50 m/s
during flight, provide position, speed and height information;
provide means to prevent the UAS from breaching the limits of the operational volume;
provide means for the remote pilot to terminate the flight
provide means to programme the trajectory;
provide means to continuously monitor the quality of the command and control link and receive an alert when it is likely that the link is going to be lost or degraded
the manufacturer's instructions must include:

description of the means to terminate the flight
description of the means to prevent the UAS from breaching the limits of the operational volume
the distance most likely to be travelled after activation of the means to terminate the flight
