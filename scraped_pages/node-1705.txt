Definition
A waypoint is a specified geographical location used to define an area navigation route or the flight path of an aircraft employing area navigation. Waypoints are identified as either:

Fly-by waypoint. A waypoint which requires turn anticipation to allow tangential interception of the next segment of a route or procedure, or
Flyover waypoint. A waypoint at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure.

(definition source: ICAO Doc. 8168)
Representation and Aircraft Behaviour
The symbols for a fly-by and a flyover waypoint in aeronatutial maps and charts can be differenciated by the circle surrouning flyover waypoints.
The typical aircraft behaviour is shown on the picture below.
