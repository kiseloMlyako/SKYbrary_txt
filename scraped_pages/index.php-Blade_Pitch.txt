Description
Blade pitch, often shortened to pitch, refers to the angle between the propeller blade chord line and the plane of rotation of the propeller. Blade pitch is most often described in terms of units of distance that the propeller would move forward in one rotation assuming that there was no slippage.
"Fine" pitch refers to a fine or low pitch angle which yields good low speed acceleration (takeoff and climb) whereas "coarse" refers to a coarser or higher pitch angle which yields optimum high speed performance and fuel economy (cruise).
