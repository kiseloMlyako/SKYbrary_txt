Description
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspectors are involved in developing, administering, or enforcing regulations and standards concerning civil aviation safety. This includes the airworthiness of aircraft and aircraft systems; the competence of pilots, mechanics, and other airmen; and the safety aspects of aviation facilities, equipment and procedures.
Qualifications
Inspectors work in one of three basic areas -- operations, airworthiness or manufacturing. Within each of these areas, training/experience requirements for a position will depend on the type of work to be performed. For example, if a an aviation safety inspector (operations) is primarily involved with air carrier operations, the requirements are different than if the individual is primarily focused on general aviation operations.
In addition, all of the inspectors must meet basic educational and medical requirements.
