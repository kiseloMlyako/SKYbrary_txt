The Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, military, tiltrotor aircraft  with both a vertical takeoff and landing (Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL)), and short takeoff and landing (Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL)) capability. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter  with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop  aircraft.
