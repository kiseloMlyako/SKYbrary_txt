FLIRECP
Description
The Flight Recorder Panel (FLIRECP) was established by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to undertake specific studies as approved by the ICAO Air Navigation Commission (ANC), and reflected in the work programme of the panel, with a view to advising the ANC on technically practical and operationally feasible ICAO provisions, as necessary, to meet the objectives specified in its work programme.
FLIRECP Work programme
1. Review the present status of flight recorder technology to establish a basis for amendment proposals for SARPs and guidance material by:
a) comparing the present flight recorder provisions in Annex 6, Parts I, II and III with the existing national or multi-national flight recorder regulations in Contracting States;
b) reviewing the present technological developments of flight recorder manufacturers and of other organizations dealing with the setting of flight recorder technical specifications, as well as reviewing other related technologies, such as, video;
c) determining what, if any, particular technical problems are being encountered with flight recorders; and
d) reviewing the report and the recommendations on agenda item 2.0 from the AIG (1992) Divisional Meeting (Doc 9593, AIG/92).
2. In order to make current ICAO flight recorder provisions with technological developments and eliminate or alleviate any present difficulties, determine those technical areas on which ICAO can take immediate action by:
a) identifying the technical areas which can be incorporated immediately into proposals for amendments to SARPs;
b) determining the appropriate timescale, consistent with the urgency of adopting the proposed SARPs and the estimated costs that would be incurred by the industry as a result of these proposals; and
c) identifying the technical areas which require guidance material and which can be prepared without further development.
3. ICAO should take to respond to these requirements by: Determine what future technological requirements need to be addressed and what kind of action
a) identifying the technical areas which require future development;
b) determining what future technical areas are associated with other on-going ICAO technical work or with work outside ICAO; and
c) determining how this work should be co-ordinated and identify the timescales and milestones needed to progress the work effectively.
4. Prepare draft details for amendment proposals for the Standards and Recommended Practices of Annex 6 and, where identified, for guidance material or for new procedures and suggestions on how to proceed with future technical developments.
