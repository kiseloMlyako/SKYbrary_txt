Description
The Aviation Safety Data Mining Workbench consists of three data mining techniques for application to aviation safety data. The first technique, FindSimilar, uses both information retrieval and data mining methods to analyse text and structured data. The second technique is called FindAssociations. This technique searches the collection of incidents to find subsets that have interesting correlation. The third technique is called FindDistributions. This technique focuses on a selected field or attribute of the incidents. It determines an overall distribution for this field. Subsets of the data are then obtained and the distribution of the selected field is identified for each subset. Those subsets that differ most from the overall distribution are identified as the most interesting. This technique helps in identifying anomalies that may be candidates for action.
