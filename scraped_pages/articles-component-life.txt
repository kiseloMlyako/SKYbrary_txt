Definition
This is tracked for all aircraft components except those fitted on an “on condition” basis and therefore controlled by inspection. Elapsed flight hours and/or flight cycles are used to ensure that remove and replace intervals are not exceeded. Removal may be for scrapping , transfer to another aircraft, or, in the case of Rotable components, for overhaul.
