Synopsis
EUROCONTROL Agency has been informed of an incident that happened on 15 September 2009 over the Southern North Sea:
"The aircraft was descending and identified a large kite/skysail flying ahead of the vessel and at around 1000 ft (just below the clouds).
It was attached to the vessel and was in the flight path of the aircraft as it headed towards a nearby installation. The 'skysail' was extended on a long cable and was moving around the vessel in an erratic manner.
Further research has shown that this is one of the first in a line of ‘experimental’ vessels using ‘skysails’ to supplement the traditional propulsion units."
