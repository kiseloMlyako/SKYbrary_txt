Nature – Intention – Time – Special Instructions
Description
The NITS briefing is a mnemonic used to guide an individual — often the captain of an aircraft or a member of the cabin crew — through a briefing format in a high-stress situation, such as in an emergency.
NITS stands for:

Nature: What is the nature of the problem or emergency?
Intention: What is the captain’s intention?
Time: How much time is needed to address the problem or how much time is available to prepare for a situation like an emergency landing?
Special instructions: Is there anything else the person receiving the briefing needs to know about the situation?

The person receiving the briefing often will repeat it back to the briefer to ensure it has been fully understood.
