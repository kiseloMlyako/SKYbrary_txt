This re-emphasis directs operators to strictly adhere to Minimum Equipment List (MEL) policy and procedures.

Joint Handbook Bulletin for Air Transportation and Airworthiness entitled Air Carrier Manual Instructions Concerning Minimum Equipment List Conditions and Limitations (HBAT 98-18 and HBAW 98-09) was issued to provide guidance to FAA aviation safety inspectors regarding the requirement for air carriers to include instructions concerning the MEL conditions and limitations. The HBAT/HBAW has since been cancelled and the guidance incorporated into FAA Order 8900.1 available on FAA's  Dynamic Regulatory System, but is included here for the information it contains.
