Description
High level, white patches, filaments or narrow bands of cloud with a fibrous or silky appearance. Because of the high altitude, and therefore lowÂ temperature, cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals rather than water particles. Viewed from the surface, because of the distance from the observer, cirrus clouds appear thin and wispy.
