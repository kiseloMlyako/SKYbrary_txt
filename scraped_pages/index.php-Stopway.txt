SWY
Description
In aviation, Stopway (SWY) is a term related to the dimension of some runways. The stopway is an area beyond the runway which can be used for deceleration in the event of a rejected takeoff. It must be:

At least as wide as the runway
Centered upon the runway extended centerline
Capable of supporting the aeroplane during an aborted takeoff without causing structural damage to the aircraft
Designated by the airport authorities for use in decelerating the airplane during an aborted takeoff

Stopways are identified by large yellow chevrons on either end of the main runway.

When a stopway exists, the length of the runway plus the length of the stopway equals theÂ Accelerate Stop Distance Available (ASDA)
