Status: UNDERWAY
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the rate of unnecessary Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alerts at high-altitude airports. A study will be conducted to determine if a change in functionality to TCAS would reduce or eliminate the number of unnecessary TCAS alerts at high altitude airports. If the safety case meets current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acceptability standards, a development of infrastructure to implement the TCAS changes will be initiated.
