Description
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)'s Technical Co-operation Programme was established to provide advice and assistance to Contracting States in the development and implementation of projects across the full spectrum of air transport aimed at improving the security, efficiency, regularity and operational safety of national and international civil aviation with a view to achieving standardization, as specified in ICAO's Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).
ICAO's Technical Co-operation Programme is intended to assist in project implementation with neutrality, transparency and objectivity and remains available for consultation long after a project has ended.
