General purpose navigator
You want to get a feel about how to interpret the behaviour of a person related to a safety event. Remember, do not use the outcome of the safety event to judge the behaviour of the individual. Just because the explosion was very big does not mean that the people involved were very bad! So look at the action or intention, not at the consequences!
First, get a broad idea: was the action above or equal, [click left icon] or below expectation [click right icon]?
"Expectation" being the behaviour you would normally observe of a professional.

How to use the navigator
This is a general purpose navigator that has been inspired on a combination of theoretical models. Our purpose is to give you a quick method to get to a broad interpretation of observed behaviour. From there, you can go into more detail by delving into established safety culture models for further analysis and for appropriate remedies.
This "navigator" module will take you through a set of structured questions.
Select the most appropriate answer. You will get a chance to compare your outcome with examples from your own and possibly other industries, allowing you to 'calibrate' your thinking and opinion about the action during the safety event.
You can use the up arrow  to go back to the previous step in the decision tree.
You can use the  next arrow to see what follow-up and consequences for the person in question could apply.
The following diagram explains the complete structure of the decision flow chart (click on picture for full image in new window). Handy if you want to have the complete overview.
