CWY
Description
In aviation, clearway is a term related to the dimension of some runways and it is abbreviated with CWY. A clearway is an area beyond the paved runway, free of obstructions and under the control of the airport authorities. The length of the clearway may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available (Take Off Distance Available (TODA)). For example, if a paved runway is 2000 m long and there are 400 m of clearway beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is 2400 m long.
