LEARJET 40
















  LJ40






 

 





The Learjet 40 is derived from the Learjet 45, but with a shorter fuselage (60 cm), and is powered by two Honeywell TFE731-20AR engines.
The Learjet 40XR is an upgraded version introduced in October, 2004, offering higher takeoff weights, faster cruise speeds and faster time-to-climb rates as compared to the LJ40. The increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration. The LJ40 is a member of theÂ Bombardier Learjet Family.
