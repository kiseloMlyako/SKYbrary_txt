Background
This safety enhancement reduces CFIT accidents by promoting comprehensive SOPs as a key element of every Part 121 air carrier’s CRM training program. Under a related project, a template for comprehensive SOPs is being developed, including SOPs that specifically address CFIT accident prevention.
Advisory Circular AC120-51E (Crew Resource Management Training) was revised to stress the use of CFIT prevention using SOP’s in CRM training. The Advisory Circular "Standard Operating Procedures and Pilot Monitoring Duties for Flight Deck Crew Members" (AC 120-7B) was also referenced.
