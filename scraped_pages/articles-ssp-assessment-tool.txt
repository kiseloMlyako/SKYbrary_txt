Description
This tool has been developed by the SM ICG to be used for assessing State Safety Management responsibilities and an SSP. Use of this tool is voluntary; however, it can be used for initial assessment or continuous improvement of an SSP. The tool is based on a series of questions or expectations that can be used by a State to assess the effectiveness of its SSP. It requires an interaction with all SSP stakeholders including face-to-face discussions and interviews with a cross-section of people as part of the assessment. It has been designed to indicate the Stateâ€™s level of compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Eight Critical Elements (CE) of a State Safety Oversight (SSO) system, integrate the SSP approach and the CEs of a SSO system where applicable, and harmonize both SSP implementation and assessment globally. The goal is to thereby establish a common standard for evaluating compliance and effectiveness of the SSP.
Disclaimer
The SM ICG initially sought to update its SSP Assessment tool to bring it in phase with the ICAO State Safety Program Implementation Assessment (SSPIA) protocol questions (PQs). However, as a result of an SSPIA program review in 2023, ICAO placed further scheduling of SSP assessments on hold with a view to the adoption of a new approach, integrating the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program (USOAP) Continuous Monitoring Approach (CMA) and SSPIA for introduction in 2025. Accordingly, the SM ICG decided that it would be beneficial to wait until details of the new ICAO integrated approach become available before re-aligning its SSP Assessment tool process.
