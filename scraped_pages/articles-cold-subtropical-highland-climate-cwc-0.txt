Description
Cwc: C = Temperate  w = Winter dry  c = Cool summer
Cold subtropical highland climate or monsoon-influenced subpolar oceanic climate; have colder summers than subtropical highland climates (Cwb) due to even higher elevations with the coldest month averaging above 0 °C and 1–3 months averaging above 10 °C. At least 10 times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter (alternative definition is 70% or more of average annual precipitation is received in the warmest six months)
Location
Dry-winter cold subtropical highland climates (Cwc) exist in high-elevation areas adjacent to Cwb climates. This climate is rare and is found mainly in isolated locations mostly in the Andes in Bolivia and Peru, as well as in sparse mountain locations in Southeast Asia.

Airports with a cold subtropical highland climate include:

Daocheng Yading, Sichuan, China
Bermejo, Bolivia

Flight safety and planning considerations
Destinations with a cold subtropical highland climate present relatively few weather related safety challenges beyond those associated with contaminated runways following rain or snow showers. 
During summer, low visibility in rain can be expected. Expect therefore that descent and approach will be completed in IMC. Be particularly aware of the location of high ground, especially if conducting non-precision and circling approaches and the fact that the higher altitude means a higher TAS.
