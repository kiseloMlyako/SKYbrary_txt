Harare International Airport (IATA: HRE, ICAO: FVHA) is an airport in Harare, Zimbabwe. The airport is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe and is the hub of Air Zimbabwe. The airport's runway, at 4,725 metres, is one of the longest in Africa. It compares with OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, whose longest runway measures 4,418 metres. The reason for this is that both are "hot and high" airports requiring long take-off runs.
