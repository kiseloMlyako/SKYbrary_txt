Description
The Regional Air Cargo Carriers Association (RACCA), formed in 2002, represents the interests of on-demand cargo aircraft operators in the United States. The typical mission for these cargo operators is to retrieve packages and other cargo from smaller communities and transport them to major airports, where they are consolidated with freight from other cities and loaded aboard larger aircraft for a longer flight to a sorting center. These operators also transport packages and cargo from larger airports back to smaller communities for distribution.
Most RACCA members are U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 135 (commuter and on-demand operations), but some fall under Part 121, which are generally large, U.S.-based airlines, regional air carries and all cargo operators.
