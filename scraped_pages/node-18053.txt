The Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner is a 19-seat, pressurised, twin turboprop airliner first produced by Swearingen Aircraft and later by Fairchild at a plant in San Antonio, Texas, United States. It was developed from the Merlin 3Â providing better systems, more power and increased takeoff weight. One version of the Metro 23 is equipped with an external pod under the lower fuselage for greater baggage capacity.
