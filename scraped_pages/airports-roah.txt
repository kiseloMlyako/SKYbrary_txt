Naha Airport is located on the Island of Okinawa 4 km west of the centre of Naha. The airport is a joint civil and military base. The airport is in close proximity to the USAF base at Kadena and the USMC base at Futenma. The extended centrelines of both of these airfields intersect the approach to RWY 18 at Naha and this restricts and influences the types of approach available.
Climatology
Humid Sub-tropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa)
Occasional Typhoons coming from South China Sea.
