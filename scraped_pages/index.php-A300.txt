  A30B






 

 





Long range wide-body airliner. In service since 1974. Airbus pioneered the use of advanced composite materials on the A300B, incorporating them in secondary structures such as tailfin leading edges. Exists in many versions as airliner and freighter. Production of the A-300B4 ceased in May 1994 with switching to the improved A300-600.
