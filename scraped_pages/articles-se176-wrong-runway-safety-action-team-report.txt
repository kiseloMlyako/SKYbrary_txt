On August 27, 2006, Comair flight 5191 crashed during takeoff from Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky. The flight had been cleared for takeoff on runway 221; however, the flightcrew inadvertently taxied onto runway 262 and ran off the end of the runway during the takeoff roll. The airplane was destroyed and of the 47 passengers and 3 flightcrew members aboard the airplane, 49 were killed and 1 received serious injuries.
Following the Comair accident, the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) initiated a study to determine the extent of the wrong runway departure issue, to identify contributing factors to the wrong runway events, and to propose mitigations.
The Wrong Runway Safety Action Team Report focuses on the analysis of wrong runway departure events for commercial operators that have occurred in the United States and proposes mitigations to reduce the risk of airplanes departing on the wrong runway. The preliminary review of wrong runway events related to operators operating under the following regulations also are summarized in this report and a more detailed study is currently underway.
