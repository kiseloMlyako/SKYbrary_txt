Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement substantially reduces or eliminates the CFIT accident rate by adding CFIT prevention training and procedures to all Part 121 air carrier training curriculums that emphasize pilot situational awareness and escape procedures for flight crews to use in the event of a terrain warning indication.
The CFIT Education and Training Aid was posted on the FAAâ€™s website and distributed to every FAA principal inspector for U.S. Part 121 air carriers. It was also sent to every Regional Technical Branch requesting a review to determine if carriers were conducting CFIT training and, if they were not, requesting them to voluntarily initiate a CFIT training program. It was determined that all U.S. air carriers were conducting CFIT Training.
