Climatology
Introduction
Within the Köppen Climate Classification System, polar climates have year-round cold temperatures with the warmest month less than 10° Celsius. Polar climates are found on the northern coastal areas of North America, Europe, Asia, and on the landmasses of Greenland and Antarctica.
((Koppen climate classification ET))
Two minor climate categories exist. ET or polar tundra is a climate where the soil is permanently frozen to depths of hundreds of meters, a condition known as permafrost. Vegetation is dominated by mosses, lichens, dwarf trees, and scattered woody shrubs. EF or polar ice cap has a surface that is permanently covered with snow and ice.
ET - Polar Tundra
Average temperature of warmest month for this climate is below 10°C (50°F) but is above 0°C (32°F). Precipitation generally is greater than potential evaporation.
Locations: Regions in North America, Greenland, and Eurasia that border the Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Peninsula, and many polar islands.
Controlling Weather Factors: Continual presence of Arctic and Antarctic air masses, polar vortex, and closeness to oceans.
Climate Characteristics: This climate essentially has no summer. At least 9 months have average temperatures below freezing. Very low evaporation because of cold temperatures. Precipitation is normally less than 250 mm (10 in.). Winds tend to be strong and cold.
