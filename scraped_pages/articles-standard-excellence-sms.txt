Description 
The Standard of Excellence in Safety Management Systems (SoE in SMS) supports ANSPs with building, implementing and improving their Safety Management Systems (SMS) in accordance with international standards and regulations, including International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO’s) Annex on Safety Management (Annex 19).
The SoE in SMS is linked with the annual EUROCONTROL/CANSO Standard of Excellence in Safety Management Systems Measurement Questionnaire. It helps participating ANSPs better understand the drivers and benefits of safety management system (SMS) maturity, track key and emerging trends and industry best practices in safety management, thus enhance aviation safety performance for all airspace users.
The SoE fosters the sharing of key learnings and SMS best/good practices among the ANSPs. The agreed best and good practices are accessible below by year.
