Runway Excursion



Description
Runway excursions can occur on takeoff or on landing as well as during taxi. They consist of two types of events:

Veer-Off: Excursion in which an aircraft departs the physical edges of a runway/taxiway.
Overrun: Excursion in which an aircraft departs the end of a runway

In view of the above, the articles related to runway excursions have been assigned to the following sub-categories:

Overrun on Take Off: A departing aircraft fails to become airborne or successfully reject the take off before reaching the end of the runway.
Overrun on Landing: A landing aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway is reached.
Veer Off: An aircraft departs the side of the runway after touchdown on landing or departs the side of the runway during line-up or the take off run.

To select a sub-category use the filter in the right data block. Because of their nature, some articles are listed in more than one sub-category.
