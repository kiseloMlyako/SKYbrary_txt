In 1999 Embraer announced the production of the Embraer E170. The aircraft had its maiden flight in February 2002 and has been in service since March 2004. LOT polish airlines were the Launch customer for the E170. After a positive response from the airline community to the E-170, Embraer launched the E-175 with two versions: short wing and long wing. First flight of the stretched E-175 was on June 2003. Certification for the 170 took nearly 2 years after the public debut; delivery of the first E170 aircraft to the launch customer LOT Polish Airlines was in March 2004. The first E-175 was delivered to Air Canada and entered service in July 2005.
