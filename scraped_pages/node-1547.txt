Definition
Primary radar equipment used to determine the position of an aircraft during final approach, in terms of lateral and vertical deviations relative to a nominal approach path, and in range relative to touchdown.

Description
Precision approach radars (PARs) are used by air traffic controllers to issue guidance to pilots during final approach using radio. These are precision approaches similar to the ILS approach.
The benefit of PAR is that it does not require any onboard equipment. However, with ILS being part of the standard aircraft equipment (together with VHF radio and VOR), this has become less and less of an advantage. On the other hand, the use of PAR results in increased controller workload and frequency congestion (see Phraseology section below). Therefore, when engaged in providing a precision approach, the controller should not be responsible for any other duties. This results in a low ATS unit capacity and consequently, the use of PAR in civil aviation has been constantly diminishing. It has a role for the military though, due to being harder to detect by missiles than ILS.
The PAR uses the working principles of primary radar - the antenna emits pulses which are reflected by the aircraft and on reception of these echos, distance and azimuth are determined. The PAR has a few specific features though:

it is much more accurate than surveillance PSRs. This is necessary because of its purpose and is achieved by the higher carrier frequency (in the order of 10 GHz compared to e.g. 3 GHz for a terminal PSR) which allows a narrower beam.
it determines aircraft position in 3D (i.e. distance from touchdown, position left/right from the extended runway centreline and above/below glide path). In older systems this is achieved by adding a second (vertical) antenna which provides distance and elevation angle (see picture below). These are used to calculate the geometric height of the aircraft. More sophisticated options are also available. Those use antenna arrays with electronic beam steering which means that there are less (or no) moving parts.
it has a higher update rate. While a terminal radar antenna normally rotates at 10-12 rpm, the PAR only sweeps a sector of about 20 degrees (between 10 to the left of the centreline and 10 to the right) and therefore updates the target position more often.


Example of PAR antennas. The horizontal one sweeps left and righr and provides distance and azimuth. The vertical antenna sweeps up and down and determines the height using the elevation angle of the antenna and the distance of the target
The approach controller sees a 3-D representation of the aircraft position which is composed by two pictures - a planar view and a vertical cut view (see picture below). The controller compares the aircraft position and height to those required and provides feedback to the flight crew at short time intervals.

An example of the picture seen by the approach controller. Note: image is generic and varies from system to system
In order to provide service using the PAR, an approach controller needs to have a PAR endorsement to their APS (Approach Control Surveillance) rating.
Phraseology
The controller performs a continuous talkdown and provides:

information about the aircraft position relative to the extended runway centreline
information about the distance from touchdown
heading instructions
information on altitudes relative to the glide slope
instructions on corrective action in case the aircraft is too high or too low

An example dialogue between a pilot and a controller (ATC) is provided below. Details may vary in actual situations.
