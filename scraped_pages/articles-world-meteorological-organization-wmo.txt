Description
As a specialized agency of the United Nations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is dedicated to international cooperation and coordination on the state and behaviour of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, its interaction with the land and oceans, the weather and climate it produces, and the resulting distribution of water resources.
Weather, climate, and the water cycle affect all regions of the world irrespective of national boundaries. International cooperation on a global scale is necessary to be able to forecast future weather and climate conditions and to wisely manage water resources. The International Meteorological Organization (IMO) was founded in 1873 to facilitate the exchange of vital weather and hydrologic information across national borders to the benefit of all. The WMO was established in 1950 and became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1951 when it replaced the IMO.
Vision, Mission, Strategic Planning
WMO provides world leadership and expertise in international cooperation in the delivery and use of high-quality, authoritative weather, climate, hydrological and related environmental services by its Members, for the improvement of the well-being of societies of all nations.
Through its Technical Commissions, programmes, projects and regional offices as well as by synergistic partnerships, WMO facilitates the maintenance and expansion of its Members' atmospheric, oceanographic and land-based observational networks; the free unrestricted exchange of the resulting data and information; and related capacity development and research in order to optimize the production of weather, climate and water-related services worldwide.
