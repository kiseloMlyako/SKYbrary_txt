Description
On 29 May 2007, a Saab 340 aircraft that was holding on an angled taxiway at Auckland International Airport was inadvertently cleared to line up in front of a landing Raytheon 1900D. The aerodrome controller transmitted an amended clearance, but the transmission crossed with that of the Saab crew reading back the line-up clearance. The pilots of both aircraft took action to avoid a collision and stopped on the runway without any damage or injury.
Contributory factors were the local procedure for the handling of flight progress strips for departing traffic; the use of multiple taxiways, including angled taxiways, for runway entry; and the captain of the aircraft entering the runway not seeing the landing traffic.
