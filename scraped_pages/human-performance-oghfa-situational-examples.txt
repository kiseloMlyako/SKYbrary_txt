OGHFA



Description
The Operator's Guide to Human Factors in Aviation (OGHFA) is a project of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) European Advisory Committee.
OGHFA is an extensive compendium of human factors information focused on further advancing commercial aviation safety.
The articles are supported by a series of situational examples, checklists and visual presentations (see below).
By way of an introduction, here below is the link to an article  to give you a broad overview of what is the Operator's Guide to Human Factors all about:
