Amendment to ICAO Doc 4444: PANS-ATM

There was a potential for unintended level deviations due to flight crews and controllers interpreting the continued validity of level restrictions differently.
To ensure an unambiguous understanding of the PANS-ATM provisions pertaining to the validity/applicability of level restrictions, new procedures (ref.: PANS-ATM paragraphs 6.3.2.4, 6.5.2.4, 11.4.2.6.2.5 and Chapter 12) were developed.
Some elements of the procedures are outlined below.

Climb Above Level Published in SID
When given a clearance to a level higher than that specified in a SID or initially cleared, follow the published profile unless restrictions are specifically cancelled. Example of phraseology to cancel level restrictions could be:
First transmission
“CLIMB TO 6 000 FEET KODAP 1 DEPARTURE”
Second transmission
“CLIMB TO FL 210 LEVEL RESTRICTIONS KODAP 1 DEPARTURE CANCELLED”.
Descent Below Level Published in STAR
Follow the published vertical profile of the STAR unless specifically cancelled by ATC and always apply minimum levels based on terrain clearance. Example of phraseology to cancel level restrictions could be:
“DESCEND TO 5000 FT LEVEL RESTRICTIONS KODAP 1 ARRIVAL CANCELLED”.
Level Restriction Issued Explicitly by ATC
In all cases, level restrictions issued explicitly by ATC in air-ground communications shall be repeated by ATC in conjunction with subsequent level clearances in order for such level restrictions to remain in effect. Example of phraseology which would have the effect of cancelling level restrictions could be:
First transmission
“CLIMB TO FL 210 CROSS ALPHA AT FL 100 OR BELOW”
Second transmission
“CLIMB TO FL 250”
