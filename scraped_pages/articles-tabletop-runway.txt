Description
A tabletop runway is a runway that is located on the top of a plateau or hill with one or both ends adjacent to a steep precipice which drops into a deep gorge. This type of runway can create an optical illusion of being at the same level as the plains below, which requires a very precise visual approach by the pilot when autoland is not used or is not available.
