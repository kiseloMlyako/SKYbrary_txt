Status: COMPLETED
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of aircraft approaching or landing on a surface other than what they were cleared for (such as the wrong runway, taxiway, or airport) through the development and implementation of technology that informs an air traffic controller of a potential misalignment event.
Related Implementation Plan
Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
Action 1, FAA ATO to establish a comprehensive list of existing and developing technologies for prevention of misalignments and establish a periodic review of approach and landing misalignment (ALM) data to prioritize air traffic facilities that would benefit from technology that would mitigate ALM risk.
