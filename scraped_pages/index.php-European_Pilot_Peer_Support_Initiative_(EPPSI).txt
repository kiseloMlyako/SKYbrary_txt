The purpose of the European Pilot Peer Support Initiative (EPPSI) is to: facilitate communication between stakeholders and interested parties engaged or planning to get engaged in Peer Support Programmes (PSP); exchange of best practices in running and setting up PSP. EPPSI is a not-for profit body.
Background
In early 2016, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) suggested to make PSP mandatory across Europe to ensure they are available in each and every company and every EU Member State, building on best practices from existing programmes.
This is why ESAM, ECA, EAAP and Mayday Foundation set up the European Pilot Peer Support Initiative – EPPSI – to exchange & promote best practices and to facilitate communication between stakeholders engaged in or planning to engage in PSP.
Why peer support?
Peer Support Programmes (PSP) have proven successful in identifying pilots that need help, treating them and, where possible, bringing them back to the flight deck. While today’s PSP cover substance abuse issues (mainly alcohol dependency) as well as training, performance and work-stress related issues and personal / grief / family problems, there is a need to further extend them to mental health issues. This is to provide help to those who have difficulties dealing with the increasing psycho-social stresses they are exposed to in their working and personal environment.
