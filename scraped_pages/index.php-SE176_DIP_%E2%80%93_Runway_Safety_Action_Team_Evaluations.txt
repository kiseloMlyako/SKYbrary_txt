SE-176: Runway Safety Action Team Evaluations
Statement of Work
The findings from the Wrong Runway Safety Action Team Report, including the part 139 airport assessment, should be incorporated into the RSAT process to enable the identification of contributing factors and threats that exist in the airport environment that have led to wrong runway departures.
The Runway Safety Action Team (RSAT) is established at either the regional or local level to develop a Runway Safety Action Plan for a specific airport. The Runway Safety Action Team’s primary purpose is to address existing runway safety problems and issues. A secondary purpose is to identify and address potential runway safety issues.
