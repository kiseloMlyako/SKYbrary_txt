NetAlert was a news update for people working in airlines, air traffic control centers and in the organisations that support them. It was published intermittently until 2019.
Written by EUROCONTROL's Safety Nets team, NetAlert aims to increase awareness of how safety nets work, how they interact, and what is being done to help with implementing and enhancing them.
