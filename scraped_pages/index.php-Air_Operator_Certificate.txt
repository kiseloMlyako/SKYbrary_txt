Aircraft Operator's Certificate
Definition
An Air Operator Certificate (AOC) is a certificate authorising an operator to carry out specified commercial air transport operations. (ICAO Annex 6, Operation of Aircraft)
Description
An AOC, sometimes alternatively described as an Air Operator Permit, is the approval granted from a national aviation authority (National Aviation Authority (NAA) to an aircraft operator to allow it to use aircraft for commercial purposes. This requires the operator to have personnel, assets and systems in place to ensure the safety of its employees and the general public. This document will as a minimum detail the aircraft types which may be used, for what purpose and in what geographic region.
