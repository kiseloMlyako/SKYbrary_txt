Appendix A
Airline Proactive Safety Programs (FOQA & ASAP) - Initial Implementation Plan Considerations
Appendix to SE10 DIP - FOQA & ASAP
SOW: Develop and implement a mutually agreed upon methodology to use de-identified FOQA and ASAP information for the purpose of proactively identifying safety related issues and corrective actions. This project assumes that legislative, regulatory and contractual actions have occurred which put protective provisions in place to prevent misuse of information. Included in this development and implementation of proactive safety programs are the development of analytical tools which will enable the identification of system safety deficiencies and corrective actions.

Membership on the planning team

AFS - FAA Flight Standards [Tom Longridge]
ASY - FAA System Safety [Dallas Bishoff]
ATA - Al Prest
Airlines [NWA - DAL - UAL (Bayless) - AAA (Merillat) - CAL (?) - ALA (Terry Clark) - Comair (Tom Monforte) - AAL (Scott Griffith)]
Underline means both. No underline means FOQA only.
ALPA (Brashear - McClure)
Continental Pilots Association
APA [Guy Peers]
Flight Safety Foundation [Jim Burin]
NASA [Yuri Gawdiak]
AIR (FAA Headquarters)
Manufacturers - Hardware/Software (Allied, Penny&Giles) (as needed for equippage input)
Question: What would it take to generate a detailed plan (timeline) for implementing foqa and asap at an airline and as an industry standard. Final Detailed Plan to be completed by August 1999.

BASIS


Interested Parties

Operators (ATA, RAA, Cargo, etc.)
Pilot Associations
FAA
NASA


The number of planning meetings to put this together

2 sub-teams (#1 ASAP, #2FOQA)
4 meetings each


Assumptions

Legislative, regulatory, and contractual Provisions a MUST
FAA - Company/Airmen/Mechanic Protections in Place
Company - Employee Protections in Place (may reword based upon membership input)
FAA Oversight / Surveillance Incentives (i.e. Maintenance, Training, ect.)
No Protections expected for Egregious Acts


Constraints/Obstacles

Legislative Provisions will probably Never Occur, as a Result Limited Retention Period is Required.
Delays Within Legal of FAA
Aircraft Equipage (classic/generic aircraft a problem)
