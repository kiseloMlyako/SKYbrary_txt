Description
Weifang Airport is an airport in Weifang, Shandong, People’s Republic of China.
Climatology
Weifang Airport has a rather dry, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate ( (Köppen climate classification Dwa)), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, like spring, sees little rain, but is crisp and short. The monthly daily average temperature in January is -3.7 °C, while in July it is 26.2 °C. Precipitation averages around 570 mm annually, with close to three-fourths of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,671 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes have ranged from -27.4 °C on 22 February 1966 to 42.6 °C on 15 June 1942.
