Mimimum Operational Performance Specification (MOPS)
Â 
Description
A MOPS provides standards for specific equipment(s) useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. The word "equipment" used in a MOPS includes all components and units necessary for the system to properly perform its intended function(s). The MOPS provides the information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated. The MOPS describes typical equipment applications and operational goals and establishes the basis for required performance under the standard. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding are provided as well as installed equipment tests and operational performance characteristics for equipment installations.
Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. A MOPS may be implemented by one or more regulatory document and/or advisory document and may be implemented in part or in total.
