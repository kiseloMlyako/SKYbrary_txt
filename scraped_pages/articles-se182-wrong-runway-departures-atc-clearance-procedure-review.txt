Background
This safety enhancement will reduce wrong runway departures by evaluating policy and procedures for the issuance of early takeoff clearances that require the crossing of multiple runways before reaching the departure runway. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will review its policy on "Taxi Into Position and Hold" (TIPH) for appropriate limits or prohibition, depending on airport characteristics.
