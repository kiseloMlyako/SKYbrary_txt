Not good eh? It could be that your judgement says this was due to the system, not the person. You think the system may actually induce this behaviour in people. In that case, check out the left icon because you need to find out where the systemic errors are so you can correct them and restore your system.
If your feeling rather is that this action had more to do with personal factors, such as rules that were clear but not followed, then this is more worrying. Select the right icon.



 

 


 

 


 

 



 













How to use the navigator
This is a general purpose navigator that has been inspired on a combination of theoretical models. Our purpose is to give you a quick method to get to a broad interpretation of observed behaviour. From there, you can go into more detail by delving into established safety culture models for further analysis and for appropriate remedies.
This "navigator" module will take you through a set of structured questions.
Select the most appropriate answer. You will get a chance to compare your outcome with examples from your own and possibly other industries, allowing you to 'calibrate' your thinking and opinion about the action during the safety event.
You can use the up arrow  to go back to the previous step in the decision tree.
You can use the  next arrow to see what follow-up and consequences for the person in question could apply.
The following diagram explains the complete structure of the decision flow chart (click on picture for full image in new window). Handy if you want to have the complete overview.
