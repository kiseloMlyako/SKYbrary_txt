Definition
(maximum) Normal Operating Speed.
Description
The normal maximum structural cruising speed which should only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances and in smooth air.
A pilot may elect to fly at Vno in a rapid descent, or if for some reason (for example an onboard medical emergency) he wishes to reach his destination or alternate as soon as possible. In such cases, fuel burn per nautical mile is greater than when flying at the normal “high speed cruise” speed.
Flying at Vno can be hazardous if unexpected turbulence is encountered.
