The 777-300ER ("ER" for Extended Range) is the B-market version of the 777-300. It features raked and extended wingtips, a new main landing gear, reinforced nose gear, and extra fuel tanks. The -300ER also has a strengthened fuselage, wings, empennage (tail assembly), and engine attachments. The maximum range is 7,930 nm, made possible due to a higher MTOW along with the increased fuel capacity. The -300ER can fly approximately 34% farther than the -300 with a full load of passengers and cargo. B77W is member of the B777 family of aircraft.
