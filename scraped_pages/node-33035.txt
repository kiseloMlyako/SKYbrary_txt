Description
A central maintenance computer collects and stores maintenance data for aircraft systems. Primary functions include fault processing, testing, fault history and reporting. The CMC monitors aircraft systems for faults, processes fault information and supplies maintenance messages. Maintainenance messages provide ground crew with detailed fault information to help in troubleshooting.  
The CMC stores and manages warnings generated by the built in test equipment (BITE) function integrated within aircraft computers. As part of a Central Maintenance System (CMS), the CMC is used for short-term troubleshooting, line replaceable unit (LRU) removal and system failure analysis or test.
Messages generated by the CMC may indicate a deterioration or loss of system function and therefore assist in in-flight fault diagnosis.
