Description
The Global Aviation Safety Road Map was developed in 2006 for International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) by the Industry Safety Strategy Group which included International Air Transport Association (IATA), Airbus, Airports Council International (ACI), Boeing, Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO), International Federation of Air Pilots’ Associations (IFALPA) and the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) (FSF).
GASR is the implementation programme for ICAO's Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP).
The Safety Roadmap provides a reference framework for all stakeholders, including States, regulators, operators, airports, manufacturers, professional organizations, safety organizations and air traffic service providers, to guide and coordinate safety policies and initiatives worldwide. This framework ensures oversight of the progress towards safety standards and maximizes the use of resources by better coordinating safety strategies and avoiding duplication of efforts worldwide.
The European Strategic Safety Initiative fitted naturally within this safety roadmap until its closure in 2016, as it provided a mechanism for coordinating safety initiatives within Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world, seeking for global alignment and minimising duplication of efforts across stakeholders. Both fit well, and have a similar ten to fifteen years temporal horizon.
