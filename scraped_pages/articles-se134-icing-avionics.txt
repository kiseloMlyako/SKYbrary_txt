Background
This safety enhancement reduces accidents and incidents caused by icing encounters by improving situational awareness during low-visibility operations and flight in icing conditions through the development and use of smart-pitch guidance systems on all new type design airplanes. The use of smart-pitch guidance systems helps prevent over-rotation in conjunction with a low-energy state or aerodynamic degradation due to the presence of ice on critical flight surfaces.

Related Outputs
Boeing, Bombardier, and Embraer have agreed to incorporate upgraded pitch guidance software into their new airplane type designs. Airbus systems currently provide alpha protection in both icing and non-icing conditions.
