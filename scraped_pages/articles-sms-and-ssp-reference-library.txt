Description
The purpose of this reference library is to provide a source of information on Safety Management System (SMS) and State Safety Program (SSP) principles and requirements. One method to bring about a common understanding of SMS and SSP is the sharing of documents, tools, guidance, and training material. The Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG) strives to share the collective body of safety management knowledge with aviation regulators and service providers worldwide.
This library contains a collection of existing guidance material applicable to both service providers and regulators, and is provided by SM ICG members (as noted by the reference). These shared documents are organized into the following categories to aid the user in identifying areas of interest: CAA and ICAO SMS Websites, Guidance, Safety Policy, Regulations, and Material for Small Organizations. Unless otherwise specified, documents are in English. Most of the resources can be applicable to many types of organizations, ranging in size and complexity. The section titled Material for Small Organizations contains material specifically written for small organizations.
