Iceland Greenland


This page contains a map of the aerodromes with identifying letter B (Iceland and Greenland). Pristina airport (BKPR) is assigned this identifying letter as an exception.
Note: The world is divided into non-overlapping aeronautical fixed service routing areas, each of which is assigned a separate identifying letter. The boundaries of these areas need not necessarily coincide with the boundaries of any State, territory or FIR. The map of all identifying letters can be explored here.
