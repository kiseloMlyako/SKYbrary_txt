Short range airliner. In service since 1984. Initial member of second generation of Boeings B737 family (also named classic) with more powerful high bypass engines and improved aerodynamics. In order to secure ground clearance the CFM56 engines have flattened undersides. Stretched version 737-400 and shorter version 737-500. Production ceased in 1999 (2000 for the 400 model).
