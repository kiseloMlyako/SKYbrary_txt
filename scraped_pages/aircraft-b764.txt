The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twinjet airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Passenger versions of the 767 can carry between 181 and 375 passengers, and have a range of 5200 nm to 6590 nm depending on variant and seating configuration. The Boeing 767 has been produced in three fuselage lengths:
