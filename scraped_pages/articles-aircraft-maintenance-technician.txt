Definition
A person who has been trained as an aircraft engineer and holds a licence issued by an National Aviation Authority (NAA) which allows them to certify work carried out on an aircraft. This Certifying Status may be restricted to certain classes of work. Often mechanical work on Engines and Airframes is distinguished in both training and approvals from electrical /avionics / autopilots. The scope of such an approval may be further restricted by aircraft type and restricted approvals may be granted which allow limited use of certifying powers in areas of work which are outside the principal area of training and competence of the LAE. Also known variously as a Licensed Aircraft Engineer (LAE) or LAE (Licensed Aircraft Engineer).
