Description
ASAT is a Monte Carlo Simulation tool that uses statistical input for Aircraft (flight dynamics, propulsion/performance, wake turbulence, on board avionics), Geographical/Geodetic (digital terrain elevation data, obstacles), Environmental (standards atmosphere, non-standards atmosphere, measured wind and temperature gradients data), Navigation ground systems, Surveillance (PRM, ASR-9, ARSR, TCAS, ADS-B), Human factors (pilot, ATC). ASAT can provide answers either in an deterministic or a probabilistic way.
