Description
Approach Runway Verification (ARV) is a surface safety tool for use in air traffic control towers that provides controllers with visual and audible alerts if an approaching aircraft is lined up to land on the wrong airport surface or on the wrong airport. ARV is intended to give controllers better situational awareness of the airport surface.
Surface Safety Portfolio
ARV is one of three surface situational awareness tools that comprise the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) surface safety portfolio.The tools were fast-tracked for development following a series of high-profile runway incursion events at U.S. airports in early 2023.
The other tools are the Runway Incursion Device (RID) and the the Surface Awareness Initiative (SAI) system.
