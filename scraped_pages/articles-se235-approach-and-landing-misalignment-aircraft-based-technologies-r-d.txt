Status: COMPLETED
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of aircraft approaching or landing on a surface other than what they were cleared for (such as the wrong runway, taxiway, or airport) by recommending the industry develop and make available, on new transport category aircraft and major derivatives, enhanced aircraft design features as feasible, that increase flightcrew awareness of approach and landing misalignment (ALM) events. Applicable new aircraft programs include new type certificate programs and amended type certificate programs involving redesign of flightdeck avionics.
