Description
On 21 January 1999, a UK Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 and a private Cessna 152 collided in mid air, at low level in day VMC with the resultant loss of both aircraft and the death of all occupants.
Investigation
According to the Report of the Investigation carried out by the UK AAIB, the Cessna 152 was most probably engaged in aerial photography while the Tornado GR1 was on a routine training flight that included low level flying.
The mid air collision occurred at a height of 655 feet above ground level. It was concluded that neither of the pilots had seen the other aircraft in time to take avoiding action.
The Investigation considered that the Cessna was operating at a height known to be vulnerable to an encounter with military fast jets and, by not using the UK Civil Aircraft Notification Procedure (CANP) or informing any ATC Unit of his location and intentions, had degraded the potential of other traffic to locate and avoid him.
The Tornado student pilot was conducting operational checks, head down, and the instructor pilot in the rear seat had a limited field of view ahead of the aircraft.
