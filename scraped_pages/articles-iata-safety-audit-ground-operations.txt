The IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO)
Description
IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) is being implemented by IATA as a complimentary standards audit to IOSA and aims to drastically reduce accidents and injuries on the ground.
Raising safety standards is the primary objective, although it is recognised that many areas of ground operations which will be covered by the audit are ones where the cost savings of safety can be directly identified and attributed, which strengthens the business case for safety improvements.
ISAGO is conducted in a standardised and consistent manner using internationally recognised quality auditing principles. Aircraft Ground Handling Service Providers are the primary target of ISAGO. Both the range of services they provide and the issues raised by multiple client aircraft operators are addressed. The format is applicable across the ground handler scale range from multinational to smaller single-airport providers. It is expected that airline-specific audits of ground handling service providers will be reduced by acceptance of the ISAGO standard in the same way as IOSA has reduced inter-airline audits.
