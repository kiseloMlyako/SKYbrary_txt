EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre Report 183 (David 1986) found that there was a strong cross-cultural bias in this test. German language speakers found the negative passive construction particularly difficult to follow. Most controllers, whatever their native language, preferred to use the English version of the test.

Generics


Type of method
Mental Capacity Test


Target of method
Strain


This test is applied before and after an exercise, with the intention of measuring a possible decrease in mental efficiency during the exercise.


Time Scale of method
Hours


This is a before-and-after test, which is applied at the start and end of an exercise. It can therefore provide no greater precision than over the entire exercise.


Portability of method
Yes


Paper and pencil (or laptop).


Observer Effect
No


No observer effects to be expected.

Potential problems with the method


Failure risk
High


This test aims at identifying a decrement in logical reasoning following heavy mental work. It has produced significant results in other contexts (nitrogen narcosis, and as a secondary task while driving). Unfortunately, the inevitable time lag between the end of the Real Time simulation Run appears to allow time for the controller to recover from any work-related effects.


Bias risk
High


A specific cross-cultural bias appears to occur with this test. Controllers whose native language is German appear to find the passive negative construction particularly difficult. (Some controllers could not answer the question: ‘B is not preceded by A -AB’). (All controllers preferred to take this test in English).


Ethical problems
None


This test is generally available for research work.


Costs of the method


Staff Cost
Low


The test forms must be distributed and collected at the start and end of each run. Either a technician or, better, the project leader or assistant project leader can do this.


Set-up Cost
Low


Tests can be generated by a cheap public domain generator, which also prepares scoring sheets.


Running Cost
Low


Forms/Computer storage.


Analysis Cost
Low


The cost of analysis is mainly the time and speed of transcription of the controllers’ responses.


Analysis data


Analysis Speed
Moderate


Although each test can be scored using the prepared score-sheet, the results must usually be transcribed manually.


Data Automation
Yes


A computer-based version of the test, with individually presented and scored questions could be developed if warranted.


Analysis Automation
Yes


Most data analysis is more or less automatised in the current circumstances. No specific human interpretation problems expected.


Status
Rejected


This test appears to work in cases of physiological stress, and where it can be used in addition to an on-going task. It does not appear to work as a before-and-after test.
