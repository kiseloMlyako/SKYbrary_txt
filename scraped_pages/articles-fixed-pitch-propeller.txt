Description
A fixed pitch propeller is the simplest of propeller designs and is associated with many light, piston engine aircraft. The angle of attack of a fixed pitch propeller is set at installation and cannot be changed during aircraft operation. The blade angle is, therefore, a compromise between the optimum pitch for takeoff, climb and cruise. In these installations, the propeller is mechanically linked to the engine and its rotational speed is directly related to the engine speed.
