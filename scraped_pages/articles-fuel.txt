Definition
Aviation fuels are specialised types of petroleum-based fuel used to power aircraft. They are refined to a higher specification under greater quality control than fuels used in less critical applications, such as heating or road transport and often contain additives to reduce the risk of liquid fuel icing at low temperatures or the explosion of fuel vapour at high temperatures.
Types of aviation fuel:

AVGAS
Jet Fuel
