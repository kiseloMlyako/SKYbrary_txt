Description
Hong Kong International Airport is the main airport in Hong Kong. It is colloquially known as Chek Lap Kok Airport, because it is located on the island of Chek Lap Kok using land reclamation. This also distinguishes it from its previous location at Kai Tak which closed in July 1998 .
Climatology
Humid “subtropical” climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa) - characterized by hot, humid summers and cool winters. Winter months are drier than the summer months. Winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and the area is subject to frequent tropical typhoons.
