Description
An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a portable electronic device that, when its leads are properly affixed to a patient, automatically diagnoses life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. It will then provide simple audio and visual commands to the operator to make selections which enable the AED to treat the arrhythmias through defibrillation, the application of electrical shock therapy which stops the arrhythmia and allows the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.
AED's are often carried as part of an aircraft's on board emergency medical equipment.
