Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
Description
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) are the rules that govern the operation of aircraft in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) (conditions in which flight solely by visual reference is possible). Because of the limited communication and/or navigation equipment required for VFR flight, a VFR aircraft may be subject to limitations if and when it is permitted in controlled airspace. Any conditions are detailed in national Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs).
Minimum requirements for VFR flight are detailed in EU-OPS 1 and JAR-OPS 3.
