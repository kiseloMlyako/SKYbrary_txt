Description
The effect of fire, smoke or fumes on an aircraft, its passengers and crew can range from inconsequential to catastrophic depending upon the type and the severity of the event, crew actions and the degree of their success, and, in the event of an uncontrollable in-flight fire, the time lapse between discovery of the fire and an on or off airfield landing. A general overview of the topic is given in the article "Fire, Smoke and Fumes".
