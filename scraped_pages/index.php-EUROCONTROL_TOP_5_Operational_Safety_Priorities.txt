Background
Pursuant to EU Regulation No 2019/123 the Network Manager shall identify operational safety hazards at network level in cooperation with operational stakeholders and assess the associated network safety risk and report them to the EASA. To discharge this obligation the Network Manager implemented dedicated risk identification and monitoring process.
Operational Safety Hazard Identification Process
The process supports aviation service providers (ANSPs, Aircraft Operators and Airport Operators) in their proactive risk management. It is a cyclic process and includes the following steps:

collection of accident and serious incident (severity A and B) data reported to and investigated by the service providers;
data coding and analysis by means of a comprehensive set of barrier models – Safety Functions Maps (SAFMAPs);
conduct of targeted in-depth risk analysis and surveys on specific topics;
identification and prioritisation of the ATM operational risks;
monitoring, analysis and update of the risk priorities, as appropriate.

The collaborative process for identification of operational safety hazards is run by the EUROCONTROL Operational Safety Group (SAFOPS) and supervised by the EUROCONTROL Safety Team and the Network Management Board.
ATM Top 5 Operational Safety Priorities
The current ATM Top 5 operational risk priorities identified in 2023 (based on the 2022 A&I sample) are:

Controller Blind Spot;
Restricted airspace infringement;
Controlled airspace infringement;
Controller detection of potential runway conflict;
Flight without transponder or with dysfunctional one.

ATM Operational Safety Studies
The operational safety studies are targeted risk studies and surveys carried out to support the analysis of the Network Manager Top 5 operational risks. Every operational safety study focuses on a particular issue and examines in detail the incident scenarios and associated safety risk, available or potential prevention barriers and their effectiveness.
All operational safety studies carried out over the years can be viewed here:

Landing without ATC clearance
Detection of manoeuvring area conflicts by air traffic controllers
High energy runway conflicts
Airside vehicle drivers impact on runway safety
Aerodrome hot spot identification on aerodrome charts
Risk of operation without transponder or with a dysfunctional one
Impact on ATC from a loss of aircraft transponder function - safety considerations
Blind spot – inefficient detection of conflict with aircraft in close proximity
Detection of conflicts at the interface to adjacent ATC sectors
