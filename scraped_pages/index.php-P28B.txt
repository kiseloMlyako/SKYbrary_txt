Piper continued to expand the 28 line rapidly. In 1963, the company introduced the more powerful Cherokee 235 (PA-28-235). The Cherokee 235 featured a Lycoming O-540 engine derated to 235 horsepower (175 kW) and a longer wing. It included tip tanks. The aircraft had its fuselage stretched in 1973 giving more room in the rear. In 1973 the marketing name was changed from 235 to the Charger, In 1974 to Pathfinder. Production of the Pathfinder continued until 1977. In 1979 the aircraft was given the Piper tapered wing and was again renamed the Dakota.
