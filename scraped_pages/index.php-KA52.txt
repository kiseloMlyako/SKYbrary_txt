The Ka-52 (NATO reporting name: Hokum B) is a modification of the basic Ka-50 design. It features a two-seat side-by-side cockpit, and is designed to detect targets and redistribute them among supporting Ka-50s. In comparison to the original Ka-50, it has a somewhat softer nose profile due to the wider cockpit, reduced cockpit armor, and large nose-mounted radome. Equipment includes radar with two antennasâ€”mast-mounted for aerial targets and nose-mounted for ground targets, and Samshite day-and-night TV/thermal sighting system in two spherical turrets (one over the cockpit and second under the nose).
