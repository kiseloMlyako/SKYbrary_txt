Definition
A generic term for a system in which the investigation of maintenance errors is carried out within the organisational context in which they have occurred, which takes full account of the concept of a Just Culture.
Description
An effective MEMS or an equivalent process may be a requirement for a maintenance and repair organisation (MRO) to achieve a Part 145 or equivalent NAA regulatory approval. The Maintenance Error Decision Aid (MEDA) system developed by Boeing was the first widespread version of a MEMS and remains popular and widely imitated.
Following on from the original MEDA initiative, the UK CAA has supported the operation of a collective MEMS function within the overall framework provided by the independently administered UK Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP). This relies on and attracts widespread UK industry participation and facilitates the sharing of occurrences between participants, thus enabling wider safety issues to be identified.
