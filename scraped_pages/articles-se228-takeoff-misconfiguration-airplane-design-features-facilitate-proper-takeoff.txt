Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of taking off with misconfigured flaps or slats by directing airplane manufacturers to develop and make available enhanced airplane design features on new transport category airplanes that increase flightcrew awareness of system failures or incomplete or incorrect takeoff configuration before taking the active runway. Applicable new aircraft programs include: • New type certificate programs, and • Major derivative, amended type certificate programs involving redesign of flightdeck avionics.
