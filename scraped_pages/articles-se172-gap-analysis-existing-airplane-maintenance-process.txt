This safety enhancement helps reduce accidents related to improper maintenance by identifying and correcting gaps within and between maintenance processes that could otherwise inhibit the intended design level of safety from being sustained throughout the life of the airplane.

The Key Safety Information (KSI) Report is the culmination of an industry effort initiated by the Certification Process Study (CPS) effort and directed to be implemented by Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) through Safety Enhancement #24. The KSI Development Team consisted of aircraft and engine manufacturers, airline operators, and aviation regulatory agencies. The goal of the project and the report is to increase the level of aviation safety via an Advisory Circular that describes methods and processes whereby OEM’s can make operators aware of Key Safety Information. All parties have worked together to develop a mutually agreed document that also outlines operator’s and regulatory agency’s responsibilities in the process.
S1000D, International Specification for Technical Publications, has gained industry acceptance as the maintenance data standard. The specification may be downloaded here.
