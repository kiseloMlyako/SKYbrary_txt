A mixture of smoke and fog.
Description
Where significant industrial pollution is present, as well as a temperature inversion, smoke and fog combine to produce a toxic mixture known as Smog. In some parts of the developing world, this is still a major health hazard which of course affects people on the ground but is not likely to be a significant in-flight issue, apart from reduced visibility, partly because the layer of smog is unlikely to be more than a few thousand feet thick and because any harmful toxins are likely to be removed by the aircraft’s air conditioning system before they enter the cabin atmosphere.
