Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of loss-of-control accidents by having Air Carriers conduct effective upset prevention and recovery training, including approach-to-stall, in realistic scenarios, using qualified flight simulator training devices. Air carriers should review, incorporate, and adopt the best practices recognized by the aeronautical community with regards to upset prevention and recovery training, including the following:

Airplane and simulator manufacturers ensure that training devices satisfactorily represent aircraft characteristics for proposed scenarios
Approach-to-stall training in realistic scenarios
Upset prevention and recovery training in realistic scenarios

A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents showed that, in many situations, the flight crew failed to properly respond to and recover from an unexpected upset, approach to stall, or stall situation resulting from flight crew loss of airplane state awareness (ASA).

Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
The Regional Airline Association (RAA) has reported that air carriers have implemented the training prescribed in the Safety Enhancement.
Industry association surveys indicate satisfactory implementation of the recommended procedures for recurrent and initial upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT).
