Description
An ATS route is a specified route designed for channelling the flow of traffic as necessary for the provision of air traffic services.
The term “ATS route” is used to mean variously, airway, advisory route, controlled or uncontrolled route, arrival or departure route, etc.
An ATS route is defined by route specifications which include an ATS route designator, the track to or from significant points (waypoints), distance between significant points, reporting requirements and, as determined by the appropriate ATS authority, the lowest safe altitude. (ICAO Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services)
The specifications of ATS routes are publicised in national Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs).
