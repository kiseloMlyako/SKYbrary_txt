Description
Large volumes of information are readily available globally on the theory of Safety Management Systems (SMSs) and to a somewhat lesser extent on the topic of SMS development and evaluation. When considering the oversight and/or surveillance of Product/Service Providers (P/SPs) who have an implemented SMS, little tangible information is available. The SM ICG seeks to address this void by providing guidance to assist competent authorities performing oversight and surveillance of P/SPs who have established SMSs where system componentry is not only “present” and “suitable,” but more specifically “operating” and “effective.” The SM ICG believes that such a document will be useful in assisting P/SPs who wish to develop an understanding of the processes that may be applied by their respective Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) as part of an SMS oversight regime.
