The broad principles governing the international transport of dangerous goods --  sometimes called hazardous materials -- by air are contained in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 18, The Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. The detailed instructions necessary to safety transport dangerous goods are published every two years in ICAO Doc 9284, The Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods, which is usually referred to simply as the Technical Instructions or the ICAO Technical Instructions.
The 2021-2022 edition of the Technical Instructions is valid until 31 Dec. 2022.
