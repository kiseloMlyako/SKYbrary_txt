There was a patient with a particular heart rhythm disorder. The treating doctor thought that this was of type A, although in doubt that it could be type B. She consults her supervisor. The supervisor agrees with her interpretation of the symptoms that it is indeed like a type A disorder. This requires treatment with a different kind of medication than type B.
Anyway, type A medication is administered. The patientâ€™s heart however stops. Everyone is getting ready to intervene and re-animate the patient. However, the heart of the patient suddenly starts pumping again and regains a normal rhythm. It was a type A; the medication was correct.
