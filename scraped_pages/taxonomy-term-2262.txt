Theory of Flight









Description
Theory of Flight is about how aircraft fly and the related theoretical background which is the inevitable consequence of flight. The content of the articles in this category is generic. Many pilots only encounter the application of some of the underlying principles they originally learned much later on. The purpose of this category in SKYbrary is to provide simple summaries of those parts of the theory of flight for which a good understanding is most likely to support safe flight, both in normal and abnormal circumstances.
