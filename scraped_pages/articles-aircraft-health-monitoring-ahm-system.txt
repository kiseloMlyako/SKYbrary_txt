Description
An Aircraft/Airplane Health Monitoring (AHM) System is a Boeing ground-based software system which acquires, analyses and presents aircraft-generated data to operator Maintenance Control Centres (MCC) to help them determine current and potential future serviceability of an aircraft. This data includes ‘low-level’ faults that do not require flight crew action and are therefore presented to pilots as status messages on the multifunction display (MFD) to which they are alerted on the EICAS.
