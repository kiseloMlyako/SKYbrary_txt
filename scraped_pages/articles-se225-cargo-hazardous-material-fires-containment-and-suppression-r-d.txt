Background
This Safety Enhancement directs air carriers, aircraft manufacturers, lithium battery manufacturers, shippers of hazardous materials, manufacturers of unit load devices (ULD), and manufacturers of packaging for hazardous materials to conduct research and develop systems for mitigating the effects of a fire involving hazardous materials through improved containment and/or suppression. The research will develop standards for containment and/or suppression of hazardous material fires (including but not limited to lithium batteries) for at least 6 hours.
