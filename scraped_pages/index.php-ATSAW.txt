Description
ATSAW (Airborne Traffic Situation Awareness) is an airborne traffic situational awareness system being introduced to commercial aviation. It is capable of providing pilots with a real-time picture of the surrounding traffic during all phases of flight.
Procedures using ATSAW will give the crew the ability to move to more efficient altitudes when operating outside ground surveillance coverage. ATSAW will also support visual separation on approach and provide traffic situational awareness on the airport surface.
The system, a development of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), is being trialled by ANSPs in conjunction with 25 Airbus and Boeing aircraft belonging to a number of major international airlines
