Description
The locator outer marker (LOM) is a NAVAID that comprises:

a locator, which is a low/medium frequency NDB uses as an aid to final approach
a marker, which is a low-powered transmitter that directs its signal upward in a narrow pattern

The LOM is placed along the flight path of the final approach, usually about 4 NM from the runway threshold (but, depending on local terrain and other considerations this may vary between 3.5 NM and 6 NM). Both facilities have limited coverage - the locator's is usually between 10 and 25 NM and the marker's is 600 m plus or minus 200 m (2 000 ft plus or minus 650 ft).
Markers provide aural identificaiton when overflown. All markers utilize a carrier frequency of 75 MHz and the identification is frequency modilated. The outer marker identification is 2 dashes per second continuously and the tones are at 400 Hz. The locator (NDB) is identified by two or three letters.
LOMs are represented on aeronautical charts by a combined locator/marker symol. The marker is oriented perpendicularly to the flight path.
