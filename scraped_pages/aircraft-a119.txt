The AgustaWestland AW119 Koala (Agusta A119 Koala prior to the Agusta-Westland merger) is an eight-seat utility helicopter powered by a single turboshaft engine and produced for the civil market. The design was derived from Agusta's highly successful AGUSTA A-109, but with only a single engine and with fixed skids replacing the retractable wheeled landing gear.
