Description
Smoke from crude oil fires can spread over a large area, well beyond the source of a fire(s). Commonly, the smoke will form a thick layer of dense, dark cloud, with a top of 5,000 to 10,000 ft.
Smoke from a crude oil fire is composed of:

Oil particles
Soot
Gases with a high sulphur content

Effects

Severe Turbulence can be expected in a pyrocumulous cloud and the cloud may contain ash from the fire.
Operation of engines and aircraft systems should not be immediately adversely affected by the smoke, but prolonged exposure will lead to airframe and systems contamination.
Smoke or Fumes in the flight deck or cabin may result in breathing discomfort and /or irritation of the eyes.
Reduced forward visibility in the cloud and reduced visibility due to contamination of windscreens.
Reduced range of nav/comm radios
Possible contamination of pitot static system causing unreliable airspeed indications

Defences

Crew/Passenger to don oxygen masks and smoke goggles as appropriate.
Monitor engine parameters and note and report any parameter shift to maintenance.
Try to fly clear of the cloud, either by climbing or descending or avoiding the cloud laterally.

Solutions

Avoidance; see Notice To Airmen and SIGMET warnings.
