High Level European Action Group for ATM Safety (AGAS)
In the light of recent serious accidents the EUROCONTROL Provisional Council (PC) decided to consider both new actions and enhancement/earlier delivery of on-going programmes. Accordingly, the PC requested the Director General, in co-operation with the Safety Regulation Commission, to establish a High Level European Action Group for ATM Safety (AGAS) in order to identify priority actions for further improvement of ATM safety across the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) area. Senior safety experts from States, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), international organisations, associations and Unions have co-operated to bring forward a series of practical actions for safety enhancement, which have been included in a European Strategic Safety Action Plan (SSAP).
