Description
The International Standard for Business Aircraft Handlers (IS-BAH) is a set of industry best practices for business aviation ground handlers that was developed by the International Business Aviation Council (IBAC) and the National Air Transportation Association (NATA).
Discussion
The standard, which was launched in 2014, is intended to enhance the safety and efficiency of business and general aviation ground handling service providers (GHSPs). It is based on International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices in the preparation of handling business aircraft.
According to IBAC, the IS-BAH is based on the implementation of industry best practices blended through a progressive safety management system (SMS) appropriate to the scale of the GHSPs, fixed base operations (FBOs) and business aircraft handline agencies (BAHA).
IS-BAH follows the structure of the International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-BAO) programme.
IS-BAH is a voluntary programme and may be self-administered. Recognition for implementation of, and conformance to, the standards is accomplished through an auditing process that results in an IBAC certificate of registration.
