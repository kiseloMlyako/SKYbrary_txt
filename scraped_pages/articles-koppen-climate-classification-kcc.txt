Description
The Köppen climate classification (KCC) is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. It is used to denote different climate regions on Earth bsaed on local vegetation. 
The Köppen climate classification divides climates into five main climate groups, with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns, which allow for difference vegetation growth. Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for those in E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup (the second letter). For example, Af indicates a Tropical rainforest climate. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other than those in the A group, indicated by the third letter for climates in B , C , and D, and the second letter for climates in E . For example, Cfb indicates an Oceanic climate with warm summers as indicated by the ending b. Climates are classified based on specific criteria unique to each climate type.
Main climates
The five main groups are:

A (tropical),
B (arid/dry),
C (warm temperate),
D (continental/snow), and
E (polar). 

Precipitation:

W: desert
S: steppe
f: fully humid
s: summer dry
w: winter dry
m: monsoonal

Temperature:

h: hot arid
k: cold arid
a: hot summer
b: warm summer
c: cool summer
d: extremely continental
F: polar frost
T: polar tundra

Climate Types
Group A: Tropical climates

Af: Tropical wet climate
Am: Tropical monsoon climate
As: Tropical savanna climate (dry summer)
Aw: Tropical savanna climate (dry winter)

Group B: dry climates

BWh: Hot desert climate
BWk: Cold desert climate
BSh: Hot semi-arid climate
BSk: Cold semi-arid climate

Group C: Temperate climates

Cfa: Humid subtropical climate
Cfb: Temperate oceanic climate
Cfc: Subpolar oceanic climate
Cwa: Mosoon influenced humid subtropical climate
Cwb: Subtropical highland climate
Cwc: Cold subtropical highland climate
Csa: Hot-summer Mediterranean climate
Csb: Warm-summer Mediterranean climate
Csc: Cold-summer Mediterranean climate

Group D: Continental climates

Dfa: Hot-summer humid continental climate
Dfb: Warm-summer Humid Continental Climate
Dfc: Subarctic climate
Dfd: Extremely cold subarctic climate
Dwa: Monsoon influenced hot-summer humid continental climate
Dwb: Monsoon influenced warm-summer humid continental climate
Dwc: Monsoon-influenced subarctic climate
Dwd: Monsoon influenced extremely cold subarctic climate
Dsa: Mediterranean-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate
Dsb: Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate
Dsc: Mediterranean-influenced subarctic climate
Dsd: Mediterranean-influenced extremely cold subarctic climate

Group E: Polar and alpine climates

ET: Tundra
EF: Ice cap climate
