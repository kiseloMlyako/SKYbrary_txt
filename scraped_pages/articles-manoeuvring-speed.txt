VA
Description
The Manoeuvring Speed (VA) of an aircraft is an airspeed limitation determined by the aircraft designer. At speeds exceeding the manoeuvring speed, full deflection of any flight control surface can result in damage to the aircraft structure. Note that some flight control inputs, such as a rapid, full deflection rudder reversal, can result in structural damage or failure even at speeds below manoeuvring speed.
