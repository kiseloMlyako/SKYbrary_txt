Description
Cranfield have an international reputation for award-winning teaching, research and consultancy in transportation safety management, human factors, airworthiness and incident/accident investigation.
Their work in aviation safety has been recognised at the highest level. They were awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize in 2011 – the highest award a UK academic institution can receive – for research and training in aircraft accident investigation. In 2013 they received the Richard Teller Crane Founders Award from the Flight Safety Foundation for sustained corporate leadership in aviation safety.
The Centre runs three post-graduate courses, namely Safety and Accident Investigation (Air Transport, Rail and Marine options), Airworthiness and Safety & Human Factors, each offering MSc and PGCert courses. In addition to these, they offer a wide variety of CPD short courses (mainly one week in length) in subjects including Safety Management Systems, Flight Data Monitoring, Reliability and Safety Assessment of Aircraft Systems.
Our intensely practical focus is supported by the people delivering our teaching and research. They work with both academics and industrialists and their team has first-hand experience in managing airline and military aircraft safety, accident investigation, design and certification, meaning students get the benefit of their extensive real-world knowledge.
Leading organisations choose Cranfield to deliver inventive solutions to their real-life problems or enhance their operational capabilities through research and training. [Source: Cranfield Safety and Accident Investigation Centre (CSAIC)]
