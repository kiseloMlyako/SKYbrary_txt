AVN Implementation Plan
The AVN Implementation Plan integrates the mandates represented in The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (HR 1000), (AIR21), the initiatives of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), and Special Committee on National Airspace Redesign Planning and Analysis (SC-192). The AVN plan provides a broad framework of flight procedure production options that are linked to specific funding requirements. Thus, it provides choices for policy makers as well as strategic direction and yearly tactical management information. Finally, the plan provides the opportunity for the FAA to effectively and efficiently deliver the improved safety benefits desired by the CAST.
