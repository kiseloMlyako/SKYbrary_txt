The Association of South Pacific Airlines (ASPA) is a not-for-profit organization that represents the interests of airlines headquartered in the Pacific island region. Association activities began in 1979.
Full membership is accorded to airlines headquartered in the Pacific island region, defined as the area bordered by Papua New Guinea to the west, French Polynesia to the east, Guam, the Northern Marianas to the north and latitude 30 degrees south, excluding Australia and New Zealand. Airlines headquartered outside the region that play an important role in air transportation in the region can be invited to become associate members.
