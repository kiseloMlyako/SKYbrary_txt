Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1006 of 22 June 2016 amending Regulation (EU) No 255/2010 as regards the ICAO provisions referred to in Article 3(1) - text published in the Official Journal of the European Union 
Objective
To amend Regulation 255/2010 by updating references to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) provisions.
Summary
Regulation 255/2010 requires that the planning, coordination and execution of air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures by the parties, or agents acting on their behalf, involved in ATFM processes shall comply with the ICAO provisions specified in the Annex to that Regulation. Since its adoption ICAO has amended a number of definitions and provisions contained in:

Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services
Doc 7030 - ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures

The Annex to Regulation 255/2010 is therefore amended (replaced) to account for these changes.
Entry Into Force
This Regulation entered into force in June 2016.
