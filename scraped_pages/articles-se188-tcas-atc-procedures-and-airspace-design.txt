Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the rate of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alerts by implementing new or modified air traffic control (ATC) procedures and airspace design processes that minimize the number of TCAS alerts. A study will be conducted to determine if an adjustment of lateral or vertical Air Traffic separation minima would reduce or eliminate the number of TCAS alerts between Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic. If safety case study meets current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acceptability standards, an implementation plan will be developed to begin planning for a change the Air Traffic Standards.
