The Lake LA-250 Renegade is a six-seat amphibious utility aircraft produced in the United States since 1982. It is a lengthened and more powerful version of the Lake Buccaneer, with which it shares its type certificate, and which it replaced in production. In turn, it gave rise to a number of variants, including the militarised LA-250 Seawolf, the turbocharged LA-270 Turbo Renegade and the LA-270 Seafury optimised for marine environments. Like the Renegade, it is a conventional mid-wing design with retractable tricycle undercarriage and a single engine mounted pusher-fashion in a pod on a pylon above the fuselage.
