Supplemental Type Certificate
Definition
An approval to carry out an aircraft type modification which is deemed by the Airworthiness Authority concerned to be a sufficient change to the original design of an aircraft type to require a specific validation. For example, an operator might wish to install an in-flight entertainment (IFE) system on their aircraft, which would involve complicated modifications to the electrical supply system on an aircraft. Alternatively called a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).
