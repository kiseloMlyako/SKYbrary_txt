Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement establishes a plan to ensure installation of DME at airports where significant numbers of older air carrier aircraft are expected to operate or where particularly vulnerable instrument approach procedures are located, allowing for a stabilized vertical descent to the runway end.
Completed Outputs
Additional DME installation is required in order for older generation commercial aircraft to use the new precision-like instrument approach procedures. FAA’s ARS developed a plan to install DME’s at locations where older generation commercial aircraft operate.
