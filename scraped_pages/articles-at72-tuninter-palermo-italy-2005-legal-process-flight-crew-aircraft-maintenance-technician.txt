The Event
Date: 06 August 2005
Location : Near Palermo, Italy
Summary: When fuel was unexpectedly exhausted en route, an ATR-72 aircraft, operated by the airline Tuninter (a wholly owned subsidiary of Tunis Air), ditched with the loss of sixteen lives - fifteen of the passengers and one of the flight attendants. It was found that insufficient fuel had been loaded because the flight crew had not checked the fuel uplift quantity before departure and had instead relied only upon the fuel quantity gauges which had been fitted incorrectly by maintenance personnel. It appeared that the practices and procedures in place at the Operator, and approved by the Regulator, had been deficient. It was also found that the flight crew had failed to fully follow appropriate procedures after the engine run down and that if they had, it was conceivable, although not in any way certain, that it might have been possible to make an on-runway emergency landing instead of a ditching.

Related Facts

Damages were also awarded by the Court, in association with the verdicts, to a relative of victims of the accident (EUR 30000) and to another party (EUR 15000)
ANSV included statements concerning the impediment to their investigation caused by the actions of the judicial authorities, in respect of access to CVR data and access to findings made during the investigation to foreign states in the interests of accident prevention.
ANSV also expressed concern that, immediately after the judicial authorities granted access to the CVR data to the parties involved in criminal proceedings in January 2007, information from the recording was obtained by the media and widely publicised.
