Description
On 13 January 2000, A Shorts SD3-60 suffered a double engine failure on approach to Marsa Brega, Libya, attributed to failure to use engine anti-icing during flight in icing conditions. The aircraft ditched into the sea and was destroyed by impact forces.
Synopsis
The following extracts are taken from the Final Report of the Investigation Committee of the Libyan Civil Aviation Authorities (published by the Swiss BFU):
"A/C HB-AAM TOOK OFF FROM TRIPOLI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ENROUTE TO MARSA BREGA AT 0929 UTC WITH 38 PAX PLUS 3 CREW MEMBERS WHILE THE A/C WAS AT FINAL APP. PREPARING FOR LANDING AT ABOUT 4.5 NM FROM THE AIRPORT, LEFT ENGINE FLAMED OUT FOLLOWED BY THE RIGHT ENGINE, THE A/C DITCHED IN THE SEA AND SANK IN FEW MINUTES"
The Report considered the causes of the accident to be:

"MELTING OF ICE FORMED AT ENGINES INTAKE RESULTED IN WARE (water) INGESTION AND BOTH ENGINE FLAME OUT.
FLIGHT CREW FAILED TO OPERATE ENGINE ANTI-ICING SYSTEM.
FLIGHT CREW WERE BUSY WITH A DISCUSSION NOT RELEVANT TO THEIR FLIGHT OR THE A/C."
