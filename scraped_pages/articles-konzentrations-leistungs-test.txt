Description
The Konzentrations-Leistung test is a test of the ability to carry out mental operations involving mental arithmetic, retaining one result and comparing with a second.
Discussion/References
References to the use of the method in ATC or similar situations.

BFS (the German ATC service) used this test in its full form as part of its selection procedure.
EEC Report 183 (1986) found no deterioration in performance on this test before/after ATCV exercises of varying difficulty.
This test is a proprietary test, used in selection and clinical testing. It is available only to registered psychologists.

Human Factors Methods












Generics


Type of method
Mental Capacity Test


Target of method
Strain


This test is applied before and after an exercise, with the intention of measuring a possible decrease in mental efficiency during the exercise.


Time Scale of method
Hours


This is a before-and-after test, which is applied at the start and end of an exercise. It can therefore provide no greater precision than over the entire exercise.


Portability of method
Yes


‘Paper and pencil’ (or laptop) test. Easily portable.


Observer Effect
No


No observer effects to be expected.


Context of studies


Laboratory studies
Avoid


 


Simulation studies
Avoid


 


Field studies

Potential problems with the method


Failure risk
High


This test aims at identifying the ability to concentrate, rather than intelligence or visual capacity. Unfortunately, the inevitable time lag between the end of the Real Time simulation and testing appears to allow time for the controller to recover from any work-related effects.


Bias risk
Low


In principle, this test ought to be unbiased.


Ethical problems
Medical


This test is not generally available, since it is a copyrighted test sometimes used in psychiatry. It cannot therefore be used without proper authority, and must be supervised by a registered psychological practitioner.


Costs of the method


Staff Cost
Low


The test forms must be distributed and collected at the start and end of each run. Either a technician or, better, the project leader or assistant project leader can do this.


Set-up Cost
Low


Tests can be generated by a cheap. Public domain generator, which also prepares scoring sheets.


Running Cost
Low


Forms/Computer storage.


Analysis Cost
Low


The cost of analysis is mainly the time and speed of transcription of the controllers’ responses.


Analysis data


Analysis Speed
Moderate


Although each test can be scored using the prepared
score-sheet, the results must usually be transcribed manually.



Data Automation
Yes


A computer-based version of the test, with individually presented and scored questions could be developed if warranted.


Analysis Automation
Yes


Most data analysis is more or less automatised in the current circumstances. No specific human interpretation problems expected.


Status
Rejected
