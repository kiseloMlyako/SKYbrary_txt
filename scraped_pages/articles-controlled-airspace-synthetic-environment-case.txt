Description
Controlled Airspace Synthetic Environmemt (CASE) is a training system that models the complete airspace system from gate-to-gate. The CASE simulator is capable of recording every single event that occurs within the scenario that has been defined. In addition to modelling the performance/profiles of any number of aircraft and ground vehicles, CASE is also able to evaluate and analyse events such as congestion, sector loading, the number of times a separation threshold has been violated the number of aircraft controlled by each control station, etc. The core elements are:

A Central Processing Suite
Up to thirty-five Pilot, Controller (and Supervisor) Operator Workstations
An Exercise Preparation System
Voice and data communications networks.

CASE was developed by AMS (Alenia Marconi Systems).
