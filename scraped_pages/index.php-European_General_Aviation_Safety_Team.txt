The European General Aviation Safety Team (EGAST)
The European General Aviation Safety Team (EGAST) was created in late 2006 and was one of three pillars of the European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI). ESSI was launched in 2006 by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as a 10-year programme.
EGAST was closed on 20 April 2016 and its functions reallocated to other groups.
EGAST was a voluntary safety partnership between GA associations, industry, EASA and other authorities from across Europe. It addressed safety in general aviation operations.
In Europe, as in other regions of the world, General Aviation (GA) is a dispersed community. Air sports and recreational aviation embrace a wide spectrum of airborne activities, ranging from powered flying, ballooning and gliding to newly-invented activities such as sky-surfing, micro light flying and paragliding.
EGAST took into account the newest regulatory materials developed by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for general aviation. Getting general aviation safety data and participation from the general aviation community is a challenge. EGAST built on the national general aviation initiatives in Europe and created a forum for sharing safety data and best practices in Europe.
EGAST Leaflets and Brochures
A series of Leaflets and Brochures has been published by EGAST, each focusing on a different operational theme of interest to general aviation pilots.Further Reading
