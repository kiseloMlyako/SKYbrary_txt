Lockhart River Airport, also known as Iron Range Airport, is an airport in Lockhart River, Queensland, Australia, located approximately 800 km north of Cairns on the eastern coast of Cape York Peninsula. Being so remote with the road to Lockhart River being impassable during the tropical wet season (Monsoons), the airport provides a vital transport hub for the community as well as being the only means of freighting in critical medical and other supplies during the summer months.
Climatology
Tropical Savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw).
