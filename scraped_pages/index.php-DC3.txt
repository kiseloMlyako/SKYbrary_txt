  DC3






 

 





The Douglas DC-3 is a fixed-wing piston-engine transport aircraft. Its cruise speed and range revolutionised civil and military air transport (the latter mainly as the C47) in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. A small number remain in service for both passenger and freight transport and in various specialist roles.
