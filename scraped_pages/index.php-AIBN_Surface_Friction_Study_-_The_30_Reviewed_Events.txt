16 January 2005 Harstad/Narvik, Harstad/Narvik. - A NAS B737-300 skidded while landing on runway 17 in crosswind conditions and turning off onto TWY D.
18 January 2005 Harstad/Narvik Harstad/Narvik. - A Spanair A320 skidded on the apron by the gate.
30 January 2005. Kirkenes, ENKR (RAP 2009-06) - A Wideroe DHC-8-103 skidded sideways while landing in crosswind conditions on Runway 24. The pilot regained control and taxied in.
30 January 2005, Harstad/Narvik ENEV (RAP 2009-07) - An SAS Braathens Boeing B737-400. Loss of directional control while landing on slippery runway 17 in crosswind conditions spun around and came to a halt across the runway. The pilot succeeded in keeping the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft was towed in.
21 November 2005 Svalbard, ENSB. - An SAS Braathens B737-400 skidded sideways while taxiing on the apron and on the runway for departure on runway 28. The departure was cancelled. The investigations were concluded without a separate report.
9 December 2005 Svalbard, Svalbard/Longyear. - An SAS Braathens B737-400 skidded approximately 50 m sideways while attempting to turn off the runway onto TWY A after landing on runway 28 with crosswind from the south.
27 December 2005 Tromso, Tromso/Langnes. - A NAS B737-300 skidded off TWY C. Towed to gate.
16 January 2006 Svalbard, ENSB. - In crosswind from the south-southeast an SAS Braathens B737-400 started a sideways skid while backtracking on runway 28 for take off on runway 10. The pilot regained control by applying reverse thrust and stopped the aircraft in a position on the south side of the runway centre line, with approximately one quarter of the distance remaining. After shut down the passengers were transported to the terminal by bus and the aircraft was towed back to the apron.
22 January 2006 Kirkenes, ENKR. - A Wideroe DHC-8-103 skidded sideways during landing roll-out on a slippery runway in crosswind conditions. The aircraft stopped at 90 degrees to RWY 24. The flight commander regained control and taxied to the terminal. Another DHC-8 aircraft landed later and advised that conditions were more slippery than the reported 35-50-56.
17 February 2006 Torp, ENTO. - An Eirjet A320 operating for Ryanair skidded off the runway after landing when a turn towards the taxiway was initiated. The aircraft was towed to the terminal.
4 March 2006 Torp, ENTO. - A Spanair A321 skidded off the runway in a turn prior to takeoff from runway 36. It came to a stop with its nose approximately 90¡Æ offset to the runway direction. The nose wheel was about one metre outside the western edge of the pavement. The aircraft was towed to the terminal.
26 March 2006 Torp, ENTO (RAP 2010-05) - A MyTravel Airways Scandinavia A321 landed on runway 18 and skidded with locked wheels onto the clearway. The aircraft was sliding and skidding while turning to the left through 65 degrees and came to a stop with the nose wheel against a concrete antenna basement at the very end of the pavement. The aircraft was evacuated on the runway and was later towed to the terminal.
21 January 2007 Sola, Stavanger/Sola Airport. - A KLM B737 PH-BPC experienced problems stopping on the remaining amount of runway. The aircraft was stopped using full reverse thrust and it came to a halt on the stopway at the very end of runway 36.
2 February 2007 Bardufoss, Bardufoss. - During the approach to Tromso airport (ENTC), the crew was informed that the runway at ENTC would be closed for 1.5 hours due to snow clearance and runway preparation. The crew decided to divert to Bardufoss airport (ENDU). The aircraft landed on runway 28 in crosswind conditions. The touchdown point was between TWY D and TWY C. With the use of spoilers, max autobrake and max reverse thrust the crew managed to stop the aircraft at the very end of the overrun (STOPWAY).
19 December 2007 Tromso, Tromso/Langnes. - The pilot of a SAS Norway B737 had problems keeping the aircraft on the runway after landing on a slippery runway in crosswind conditions in a strong and gusty south-westerly wind. Just after landing, the aircraft started to weathercock into wind and skidded partially sideways along the whole length of the runway. The pilot feared that the aircraft would leave the runway and ordered the cabin crew to prepare for a crash. Max manual braking was initiated (autobrake 3 selected prior to landing) without noticeable effect (friction-limited). The aircraft stopped at the very end of the paved surface of the over-run. The crew needed assistance from a tow tractor in order to maneuver the aircraft before taxiing to the terminal in a normal manner.
5 January 2008 Oslo Gardermoen, Oslo/Gardermoen Airport. - After landing, a MyTravel Scandinavia A321 entered a skid and departed the runway/taxiway structure when exiting the active runway 19R. The aircraft continued straight across the field and onto TWY M (parallel to the runway). After the incident, the aircraft was taxied to the terminal via standard taxiways. The aircraft was not damaged in this excursion.
1 February 2008 Oslo Gardermoen, ENGM. - A KLM B737 was unable to slow down sufficiently during braking in order to make the turn onto the last exit. The aircraft stopped 2 m outside the threshold lights at the end of the runway. The aircraft was towed to the terminal.
13 January 2010 Bardufoss, Bardufoss. - A NAS B737-300 was cleared to taxi via taxiway Y to holding position runway 28. After crossing taxiway C, the crew was advised to taxi with caution since taxiway Y was slippery. The crew tried light braking, which caused the wheels to lock and skid sideways and as a result, the aircraft skidded off the taxiway. Taxiway Y had been closed 10 minutes earlier because it was very slippery, but the crew had not been informed. The taxiway was covered with wet ice and the crew perceived the braking action as NIL.
23 January 2010 Svalbard, Svalbard/Longyear. - A SAS B737-400 skidded sideways along the centreline while landing on runway 28 in a 10-12 kt crosswind from the southwest. The crew managed to keep the aircraft on the centre line of the runway and was able to stop on the runway. The aircraft stopped at the western end of the runway with a heading of approximately 100 degrees off the runway direction, facing south. The crew perceived the friction to be POOR.
25 January 2010 Svalbard Svalbard/Longyear (Investigation Ongoing) - A West Air Sweden RJC 200 skidded off the south (left hand) side of the runway after landing on runway 28. The excursion happened on the final quarter of the runway.
27 April 2010 Hartstad/Narvik Harstad/Narvik. - A West Air Sweden CRJ 200 landed on runway 17 in crosswind conditions, with braking action reported as GOOD. The crew perceived the friction to be POOR to NIL. The aircraft skidded sideways to approximately 2 m from the edge of the runway, but the crew managed to regain directional control and steer the aircraft back towards the centreline. The aircraft stopped by taxiway D, which are approximately two thirds of the way along runway 17.
