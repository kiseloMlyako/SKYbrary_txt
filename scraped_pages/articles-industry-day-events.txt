Overview
The Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG), a group of 18 aviation regulatory bodies, was established in 2009 to promote a common understanding of safety management principles and requirements, facilitating their application across the international aviation community. Since then, the group has produced several products and has begun to focus more on outreach to the greater international aviation community. To that end, the SM ICG hosts Industry Day events during its semi-annual meetings.
