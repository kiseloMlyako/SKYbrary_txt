Status: COMPLETED
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of loss-of-control accidents by having manufacturers implement bank angle alerting and recovery guidance display systems on applicable new transport category airplane (TCA) programs. Applicable new TCA programs include:

New type certificate programs
Major derivative, amended type certificate programs involving redesign of flight deck avionics.

A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents determined that excessive bank, resulting from flight crew loss of airplane state awareness (ASA), played a role in 6 accidents. To provide assistance during recovery from unusual bank angles, and reduce fatal accidents due to spatial disorientation, manufacturers should develop and implement bank angle alerting and recovery guidance display systems in accordance with Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) 25.1322, amendment 25-131 on applicable new TCA programs launched after January 1, 2015.
