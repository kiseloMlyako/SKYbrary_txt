Description
The Brazilian Commercial Aviation Safety Team (BCAST) is a committee comprised of representatives of civil aviation service providers and other organizations in Brazil that have the capacity to propose and promote improvements in commercial aviation safety. The president and vice president of BCAST are drawn from the country's airline sector. ANAC – Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil, the Brazilian civil aviation authority, serves as the BCAST secretariat. 
BCAST, which has been operating since 2016, initially was modeled after the highly successful U.S. Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST). Like CAST, BCAST produces safety enhancements that are made available to industry.
BCAST has the following working groups:

Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)
Loss of control-inflight (LOC-I)
Mid-air collisions (MAC)
Runway excursions (RE)
COVID-19
Data sharing
Operational training

BCAST meetings four times a year. It also is planning an annual InfoShare event, modeled after the semi-annual Aviation Safety InfoShare in the U.S. 
BCAST also works closely with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Regional Aviation Safety Group-Pan America (RASG-PA) and the related Pan American Regional aviation Safety Team (PA-RAST).
