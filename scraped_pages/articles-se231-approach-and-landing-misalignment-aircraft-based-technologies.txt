Status: COMPLETED
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of aircraft approaching or landing on a surface other than what they were cleared for (such as the wrong runway, taxiway, or airport) through the development of aircraft design features as feasible, that increase flightcrew awareness of runway/taxiway/aerodrome misalignment events.
Related Implementation Plan
Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Actions
Action 1, manufacturers evaluate both their current production fleet and/or avionics suites and new type design aircraft, as well as incorporate these technologies as feasible and Aircraft operators evaluate available technology against their fleets and decide what technology they will incorporate into their fleet.
