Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)
The way in which enhanced capabilities of satellite-based navigation and digital data link communication systems will permit the next generation of ATM systems to combine the features of Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) (ADS) and Controller-to-Pilot Data Link Capability (CPDLC) with the conventional ATC functions. The combination of these enabling CNS technologies and their application to ATM has become known as CNS/ATM. (EUROCONTROL EATM Glossary of Terms)
