Definition
A norm is behaviour or a judgement rule shared and accepted by a group.
Discussion
Individuals that do not behave according to the norm can be excluded or marginalised from the group. Usually norms are informal rules that are not written down and a rarely openly discussed (implicit rules). However they have a powerful influence on behaviours of the group members.
