The Beriev A-40 Al'batros (Albatross, NATO reporting name: Mermaid) was a jet-engined amphibious flying boat designed by the Beriev Aircraft Company for the anti-submarine warfare role. Intended as a replacement for the Beriev Be-12 amphibian and the land-based Ilyushin Il-38, the project was suspended after only two prototypes had been manufactured, due to the break up of the Soviet Union.
