Description
The Association of European Airlines (AEA) was founded in 1952 as a trade body that eventually brought together 32 major airlines, and was the voice of the European airline industry for over 60 years. It shut down in the end of 2016. The same year some of the member airlines formed a new association - Airlines for Europe (A4E). AEA worked in partnership with the institutions of the European Union and other stakeholders in the value chain, to ensure the sustainable growth of the European airline industry in a global context. The association's goals were to:

Promote aviation’s role in Europe’s future
Innovate for the benefit of customers
Contribute to better, smarter and more cost-effective regulation
Accelerate progress towards a Single European Sky
Decarbonise aviation
Ensure conditions for fair competition: a level playing field
Champion a global security framework

AEA was involved in a number of safety research projects, one of the most notable being the Ground De/Anti Icing Working Group.
