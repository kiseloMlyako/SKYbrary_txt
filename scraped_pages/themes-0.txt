CAST Safety Enhancement Plan
The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) was founded in 1997 with a goal to reduce the commercial aviation fatality risk in the United States by 80 percent by 2007. To achieve this ambitious goal, the CAST developed and started implementing a comprehensive Safety Enhancement Plan. By 2007, CAST was able to report that, by implementing the most promising safety enhancements, the fatality rate of commercial air travel in the United States was reduced by 83 percent. CAST continues to develop, evaluate and add Safety Enhancements to the CAST Plan for continuing fatality risk reduction.
Single European Sky
The Single European Sky is a European initiative aimed to enhance safety and efficiency of air transport in Europe by restructuring European airspace as a function of air traffic flows and by reducing the fragmentation of the air traffic management in Europe. The first legislative package (SES I) adopted in 2004 comprises four basic regulations, which reinforce safety and foster the restructuring of European airspace and air navigation services. The regulations provide the framework for the creation of additional capacity and for improved efficiency and interoperability of ATM system in Europe.
