Background
This safety enhancement reduces fatal accidents due to loss of control. New airplane designs should include angle-of-attack/low speed protection, thrust asymmetry compensation, and bank angle protection using hard or soft limits.
Fly-by-wire active flight envelope protection technology does not exist for turboprop airplanes. Turboprop manufacturers should strive, to the fullest extent, to provide the protection benefits of these systems in their new airplane designs.

Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
The Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) communicated with Airbus Industries, Boeing, Embraer, and Bombardier Aerospace to encourage them to incorporate angle-of attack/low speed protection, thrust asymmetry compensation, and bank angle protection into all new fly-by-wire aircraft designs. All four manufacturers have agreed to incorporate flight envelope protection into future airplane designs.
