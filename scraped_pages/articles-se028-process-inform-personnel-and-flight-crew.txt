Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) communicated to aircraft manufacturers the importance of timely discrimination of essential safety information and procedures to aircraft operators. As guidance, AIA also distributed Handbook Bulletin Air Transportation, Flight Standards Policy - Company Operating Manuals and Company Training Programs for Compliance with Current Airplane or Rotorcraft Revisions (HBAT 99-07). The HBAT has since been cancelled and the guidance incorporated into other material, but is included here for the information it contains.
