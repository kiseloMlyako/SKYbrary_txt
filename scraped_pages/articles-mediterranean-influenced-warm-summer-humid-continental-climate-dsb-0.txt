Dsb: D = Snow  s = Dry summer b = Warm summer
Description
Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate; these climates are characterized by extreme seasonal changes; winters are cold to very cold with the coldest month averaging below 0 °C, average temperature of the warmest month below 22 °C and at least four months averaging above 10 °C. At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than 30 mm. Winter storms can produce significant amounts of snow. Summers are dry with little in the way of convective activity.
The Dsb climate is found in high elevation areas such as the Rocky Mountains of North America (e.g.Mammoth Yosemite, California, USA,  ), central Turkey and Central Asia (e.g. Darwaz, Afghanistan)
