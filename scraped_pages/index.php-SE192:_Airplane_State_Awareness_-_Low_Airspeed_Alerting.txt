Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of loss-of-control accidents by having Air Carriers implement low airspeed alerting on existing transport category airplane (TCA) type designs as practical and feasible.
A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents determined that low energy state and stall, resulting from flight crew loss of airplane state awareness (ASA), played a role in 8 events. To further improve early flight crew awareness of a decreasing energy state throughout the U.S. fleet, air carriers should implement existing manufacturer service bulletins to provide low airspeed alerting on existing transport category type designs as applicable.
