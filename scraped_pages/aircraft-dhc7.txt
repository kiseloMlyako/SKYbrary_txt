Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) turboprop airliner. In service since 1978. Designed as a STOL aircraft. The only major development of Dash 7 was the 150 series with higher take-off weight. The 151 was the equivalent freighter. Production ended in 1988 following Bombardiers take-over of the DE HAVILLAND CANADA. 111 Dash 7 were built, approx. 60 were in commercial service in 1999. RC-7B modified ex-airliner DHC-7 to airborne reconnaissance aircraft for US Army. Six aircraft will be delivered by 2003.
