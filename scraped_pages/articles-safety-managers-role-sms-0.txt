Description
The objective of this document is to provide guidance on the roles and responsibilities of the Safety Manager; associated knowledge, skills, and attitudes; examples of do and don'ts; considerations on the scalability of the Safety Manager tasks based on the size and complexity of the organization; and training syllabus for consideration.
It is important not to view Safety Manager roles and responsibilities in isolation, but rather how the role should be integrated with the entire organization. In addition, it is important that any decisions made with regards to the role of the Safety Manager do not compromise the responsibilities held by other managers. Finally, it is also important to consider that, depending on the size and complexity of the organization, these roles and responsibilities may vary from one organization to another.
This document is primarily meant for the Safety Manager; however, it is also relevant for senior management personnel and regulators seeking to better understand the roles and responsibilities of the Safety Manager in the implementation and maintenance of Safety Management Systems (SMS).
The Safety Manager, as defined by the Safety Management International Collaboration Group (SM ICG), is the responsible individual and focal point for the implementation and maintenance of an effective SMS.
