Definition
VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR) is defined as VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range, an aircraft navigation system operating in the VHF band.
Description
VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR), is an aircraft navigation system operating in the VHF band. VORs broadcast a VHF radio composite signal including the station's Morse Code identifier (and sometimes a voice identifier), and data that allows the airborne receiving equipment to derive the magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft. This line of position is called the "radial". Alternatively, the VOR radial may be combined with magnetic heading from the aircraft compass to provide a bearing relative to the aircraft axis, which cn be used to home to the beacon. VOR beacons are frequently used as way-points on conventional Airway systems, or as the basis for a Non-Precision Approach.
