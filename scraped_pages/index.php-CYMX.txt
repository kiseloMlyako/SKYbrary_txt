Description
An airport located 21 nm north west of Montreal city centre which was intended to replace Dorval as Montreal's main international airport but which never assumed that role. It currently survives as a relatively little-used cargo airport with closure and terminal demolition now expected.
Climatology
Humid Continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) - The humid continental climate is marked by variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance. Summers are often warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms and winters can be very cold with frequent snowfall and persistent snow cover.
