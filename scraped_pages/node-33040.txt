Description
The FCTM complements, and is often a supplement to the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM), and is designed to provide pilots with practical information on how to fly the aircraft (standard operating procedures or SOPs).
 
The FCTM may include separate sections on Normal and abnormal/emergency procedures, and include information on task sharing, standard calls and task management. If there is any discrepancy between the procedures in the FCTM and those in the AFM, the procedures in the AFM have primacy.
