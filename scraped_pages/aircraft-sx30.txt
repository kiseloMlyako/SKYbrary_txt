  SX30






 





A high-performance homebuilt aircraft featuring two seats and developed by Ed Swearingen of San Antonio, Texas during the 1980s. The aircraft was offered as a kit, but the kit was not a comprehensive kit like contemporary designs and its construction was beyond the abilities of the average amateur aircraft builder. The plane featured a 300 horsepower (220 kW) six-cylinder engine.
