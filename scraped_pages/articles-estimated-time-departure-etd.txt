Description
The estimated time of departure (ETD) is based on the scheduled time of departure (STD). Ideally, ETD = STD + taxi time, but in most cases there are deviations due to various factors, e.g. assigned CTOT, delays due to de-icing or traffic congestion, etc. ETD is mostly used in the operational environment and is the base for en-route estimates and estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculation.
