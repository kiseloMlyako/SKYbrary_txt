Description
EUROCONTROL's Voluntary ATM Incident Reporting (EVAIR) provides a common platform for State Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and aircraft operators (AOs) to comply with Air Traffic Management (ATM) safety requirements when exchanging safety-related information.
EVAIR is the first example of voluntary ATM incident data collection at pan-European level. It was developed to enable a proactive approach to ATM and Air Navigation Service (ANS) safety.
The collaboration with ANSPs and AOs, who are actively involved in the reporting, enhances EVAIRâ€™s contribution to the improvement of ATM safety.

The incident reporting, data collection and feedback process as main activities rely on the fruitful and constant collaboration between airlines and their associations (IATA, ERAA, IACA, ELFA), Air Navigation Service Provides (ANSPs) and EUROCONTROL.

In this process, EUROCONTROL facilitates the dialogue and exchange of data between airlines and ANSPs; it shares information and makes it available for stakeholders to support a preventive and proactive approach to safety in the form of active feedback, quick fix of problems and sharing of lessons learned.
