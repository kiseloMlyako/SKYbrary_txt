Description
"The UK Flight Safety Committee is an unincorporated association of professionals dedicated to the improvement of Commercial Aviation Safety. Members meet regularly to exchange safety information and to examine ways to improve safety and to avoid incidents and accidents."
Membership extends beyond UK operators to many airlines around the world including (for example) Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. For a full list of current members, see the UKFSC website.
In November 2008, the UKFSC was welcomed as a partner in the SKYbrary project.
