Description
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) General Aviation Safety Outreach Initiative was launched to increase the general aviation (GA) community's awareness of safety management practices that could elevate the community's overall safety performance. FAA leadership, management, inspectors and members of the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) share information about safety management practices with the GA community through outreach during routine surveillance and interaction. Outreach occurs in a variety of forms, including formal communications and messaging from FAA leadership to informal conversations between an inspector and a GA certificate holder. 
Primary Goals
The primary goals of the GA Safety Outreach Initiative include:

Increase the GA community's awareness of safety attributes and the benefits of applying them, and
Increase air operators' and air agencies' participation in the Safety Management System Voluntary Program (SMSVP).

According to FAA, reaching these goals will result in lower accident and incident rates in the GA community.
