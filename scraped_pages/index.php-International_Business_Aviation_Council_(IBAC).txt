Description
Founded in 1981, the International Business Aviation Council (IBAC) is a non-profit, international trade association. Its offices are co-located with the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada, at which the IBAC holds permanent observer status. IBAC represents business aviation associations from around the world, participating in various ICAO bodies whose work affects business aviation. It thus helps to ensure that the global aviation standards, developed by ICAO, reflect business aviation needs.

Mission

Initiatives and Activities
Beyond providing advocacy and expertise by participating in various ICAO bodies on behalf of the business aviation communities, IBAC has undertaken a number of projects, activities and initiatives. Many of these activities are safety, educationally, or environmentally focused and include:

International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-BAO) - IS-BAO was developed by the business aviation community and was launched by IBAC in 2002. It is designed to foster and encourage the use of high quality operating practices
International Standard for Business Aircraft Handlers (IS-BAH) - In 2014, IBAC introduced IA-BAH, a set of global industry best practices for business-aviation ground handling agencies and Fixed Base Operators (FBO). The program is based on the success, philosophy and structure of IS-BAO and is the first industry standard to bring the SMS concept to ground handling
Auditor accreditation - IBAC provides accreditation to individuals to conduct IS-BAO or IS-BAH audits and assess organisational conformance to the respective programs. To qualify for accreditation, individuals must have a knowledge of both ICAO and their National Aviation Authority (NAA) regulations, a comprehensive understanding of SMS and quality systems, and a background in business aviation or ground handling
SafetyNet webinars - SafetyNet webinars, on a variety of safety topics, are presented by IS-BAO or IS-BAH affiliates who have been identified as subject matter experts
Environmental leadership - IBAC coordinates the inputs from its business aviation membership to the processes at ICAO that set global aviation noise and emissions standards and policies. Business aviation is striving to reduce emissions and, guided by IBAC, is active in two significant initiatives - Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuel (SAJF) and Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)
Aircrew identification cards - Introduced in 1985 and issued to aircrew of member associations, the IBAC aircrew identification card is widely recognised by airport security officials thus facilitating crew access to business aircraft and support facilities at airports around the world
