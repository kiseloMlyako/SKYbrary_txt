Description
International airport serving Munich in Southern Germany.
Climatology
Humid Continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) - Variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance. Summers are often warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms and winters can be very cold with frequent snowfall and persistent snow cover.
Munich's altitude and proximity to the northern edge of the Alps mean that precipitation is high. Rain storms often come violently and unexpectedly. The range of temperature between day and night or summer and winter can be extreme. A warm downwind from the Alps (a föhn wind) can change the temperatures completely within a few hours, even in the winter.
