Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to outline research to be conducted by the aviation community (government, industry and academia) to develop and assess training methods and realistic scenarios that can address the attention-related human performance limitations observed in the airplane state awareness (ASA) event data, including channelized attention, confirmation bias, and startle/surprise, with accompanying performance measures.
A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents showed that issues with flight crew attention were involved in 16 of the 18 events. The aviation community should conduct research on methods for understanding the phenomena of flight crew channelized attention, confirmation bias, startle/surprise, and diverted attention.

Research and training organizations develop methods to detect and measure attention-related human performance limitations.
Research organizations should work with industry partners (air carriers, manufacturers, and commercial training providers) to develop methods and guidelines for creating training scenarios that induce attention-related human performance limitations and develop and assess potential mitigations to these issues in the training environment.
