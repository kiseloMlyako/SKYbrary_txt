Description
On 12 January 1999, control of a Fokker F27-600 was lost on approach to Guernsey Airport, Channel Islands, as a consequence of the aircraft being operated outside the load and balance limitations.
Synopsis
This is an extract from the Accident Report published by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (UK) (AAIB), UK:
"The accident occurred when control of the cargo aircraft, carrying three tonnes of newspapers, was lost during the final stages of an approach to Guernsey Airport. Moments after the wing flaps were lowered to their fully down position, the nose of the aircraft rose and the crew were unable to prevent it rising further. The nose continued to rise until the aircraft's pitch attitude was near vertical. Although the crew applied nose down pitch trim and high engine power, the aircraft lost flying speed, stalled and entered an incipient spin. It descended in a shallow nose down pitch attitude with little forward speed and crashed…"
The listed the causal factors as:

"The aircraft operated outside the load and balance limitations.
Loading distribution errors went undetected because the load sheet signatories did not reconcile the cargo distribution in the aircraft with the load and balance sheet.
The crew received insufficient formal training in load management."
