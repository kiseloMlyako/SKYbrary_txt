Summary

On 8 February 2007, A Gulfstream G-200 on an eastbound transatlantic delivery flight being undertaken by its operator entered a high altitude stall resulting from crew flight planning errors after which flight at an altitude incompatible with the performance limits of the aircraft as loaded was attempted. The crew response to this situation was confused but eventually, recovery to controlled flight was achieved. The Investigation attributed the  event to lack of flight crew understanding of the core principles of flight at high altitude.
