Background
This safety enhancement ensures that all airline operators publish and enforce clear, concise, and accurate flight crew Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These SOPs should include expected procedures during pre/post flight and all phases of flight; i.e., checklists, simulator training, PF/PNF duties, transfer of control, automation operation, rushed and/or unstabilized approaches, rejected landings and missed approaches, in-flight pilot icing reporting, and flight crew coordination. Operator instructors and check airmen should ensure these SOPs are trained and enforced in their aircrew proficiency and standardization programs.
