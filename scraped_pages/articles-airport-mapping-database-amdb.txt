Description
An AMDB is a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of an airport describing:

the spatial layout of an airport;
the geometry of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, buildings) described as points, lines and polygons;
further information characterising the features and their functions which are stored as attributes (e.g. surface type, name/object identifier, runway slope).

AMDB are used in a wide variety of applications but mostly in on-board applications such as Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs). These applications are intended primarily to improve the user’s situational awareness and/or to supplement surface navigation, thereby increasing safety margins and operational efficiency.
Multiple user groups, such as pilots, controllers, aerodrome managers, aerodrome emergency/security personnel etc, can benefit from using AMDBs.
