Description
Værøy Airport (Norwegian: Værøy flyplass) is a closed regional airport on the island of Værøy in Norway. It was used between 1986 and 1990 and was operated by the Municipality of Værøy. It was plagued with low regularity caused by difficult wind conditions. Following the fatal Widerøe Flight 839 accident, the airport was closed and replaced by Værøy Heliport. The airport was served by twelve weekly services to Bodø and Røst by Widerøe, who used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft.
