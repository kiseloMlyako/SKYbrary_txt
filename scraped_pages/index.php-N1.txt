Description
In an axial flow jet engine, N1 refers to the rotational speed of the low speed spool which consists of the fan, the low pressure compressor and the low pressure turbine, all of which are connected by a concentric shaft.
On many jet engines, N1 is the primary indication of engine thrust as an alternative to Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) that is used on others.
