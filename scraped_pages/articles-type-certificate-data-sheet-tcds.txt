Description
The Type Certificate Data Sheet includes general information about the design such as dimensions, wing loading, limiting airspeeds and required placards and markings, control surface travel, engine installations and, where applicable, approved engine/propeller combinations. In practice, the ‘datasheet’ is more likely to be a lengthy document or an electric file.
