Description
International airport serving the Norwegian capital.
Climatology
Humid Continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) - Variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance. Summers are often warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms and winters can be very cold with frequent snowfall and persistent snow cover.
In the winter, steam fog sometimes forms over the lakes to the north of the airfield and, if there is a light Northerly wind, the fog gets blown over the airfield often without much notice.
