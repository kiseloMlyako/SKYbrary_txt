Summary
This Regulation amends Regulations No 1206/2011 and No 1207/2011. The most notable changes are listed below:
Changes to Regulation No 1206/2011:
New provision: State aircraft engaged on nationally sensitive operations or training, that require security and confidentiality, are not to be assigned a conspiquity code.
Changes to Regulation No 1207/2011
The requirement to ANSPs to inform the operator in case of observed deviation from the performance requirements and for the operator follow-up actions is removed.
The transponder equippage requirements are updated by:

extending the deadline to 7 December 2020 (instead of 7 June 2020). This applies to both civil and State aircraft.
extending the scope of the requirements to include aircraft with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued on or after 7 June 1995 (instead of before 8 January 2015).
requirements to aircraft with a MTOM exceeding 5 700 kg or with a TAS greater than 250 knots will not apply if:

they are being flown to undergo maintenance;
they are being flown for export;
their operations will be ceased by 31 October 2025.


a provision is added that operators of aircraft with a first certificate of airworthiness issued before 7 December 2020 are to comply with the equippage requirements by 7 June 2023 if they have established an approprate retrofit programme and have not benefitted from any Union funding for this purpose.
a provision is added that aircraft with temporarily inoperative transponders, may be operated in the SES airspace for a maximum of 3 consecutive days. This also applies to State aircraft.
changing the provision for compliance with ICAO Annex 10 by requiring compliance with Volume IV, including all amendments up to No 77 (instead of up to 85, which was considered to impose an undue economic burden).

The provision allowing Member states to impose ADS-B carriage requirements is removed.
The provision that the equipment is to be checked at least every two years is removed.
The assignment of 24-bit ICAO addresses by Member States is to comply with Annex 10, Volume III including all amendments up to No 90 (was previously up to No 85).
The aircraft exemption provisions are removed.
A provision is added that for non-equipped State aircraft the indicators SUR/EUADSBX or SUR/EUEHSX or SUR/EUELSX (or an appropriate combination of those) is to be included in Item 18 of the flight plan.
Annex II (transponder capability requirements) is amended by:

changing the provision for compliance with ICAO Annex 10 by requiring compliance with Volume IV, including all amendments up to No 77 (instead of up to 85, which was considered to impose an undue economic burden).
the continuity requirements for transponders supporting Mode S and ADS-B are removed.

Annex IV (requirements for formal arrangements between ANSPs) is amended by:

removing the requirement to include the communications means used to exchange the surveillance data.
removing the requirement to include quality requirements for the surveillance data.
consolidating (summarizing) the requirement to include the agreed service levels.
