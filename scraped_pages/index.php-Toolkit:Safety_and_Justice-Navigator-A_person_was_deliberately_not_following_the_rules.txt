If this is the first time it happened, select the left icon.

Explanation routine
Have you seen this before?
The Routine Test is designed to find out more about the person - event combination that was concerned with the particular error or procedural deviation.
Three classes are possible here:

This is the first time it happened.
This occurred more than once by the same person.
Everybody does it like that.

Depending on the characteristic of the safety behaviour, one can understand there are different possible follow-ups.
