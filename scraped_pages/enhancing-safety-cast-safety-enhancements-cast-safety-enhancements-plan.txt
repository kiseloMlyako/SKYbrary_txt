CAST Safety Enhancements Plan



Description
The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) was founded in 1997 with a goal to reduce the commercial aviation fatality risk in the United States by 80 percent by 2007. To achieve this ambitious goal, the CAST developed and started implementing a comprehensive Safety Enhancement Plan. By 2007, CAST was able to report that, by implementing the most promising safety enhancements, the fatality rate of commercial air travel in the United States was reduced by 83 percent. CAST continues to develop, evaluate and add Safety Enhancements to the CAST Plan for continuing fatality risk reduction.
Below you will find listed each Safety Enhancement included in the plan.
