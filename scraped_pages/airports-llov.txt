Ovda Airport is a military air base and former joint-use civilian airport in the Uvda region of southern Israel, about 60 km north of Eilat. It was the country's second international airport. The airport ceased handling civilian flights on 31 March 2019 thanks to the opening of Ramon Airport, which is located much closer to the city of Eilat than Ovda.
