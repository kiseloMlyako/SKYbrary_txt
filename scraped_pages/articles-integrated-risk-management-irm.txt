Description
Successful aviation risk management should aim for overall risk reduction in the system, according to the ICAO Safety Management Manual (Doc 9859). This process requires the analytical assessment of the whole system at the highest level of the appropriate entity (State, regional organizations, service providers). The assessment and integration of functional system needs and interdependence are referred to as integrated risk management (IRM), which focuses on the overall risk reduction of the organization. IRM is a distinct high-level concept to leverage the expert advice of sector specific risk management and provide holistic feedback to achieve the highest level of system performance at a socially acceptable level.
