Summary

On 12 February 2009, a Bombardier DHC-8-400 on a night ILS approach to Buffalo-Niagara airport departed controlled flight and was completely destroyed by ground impact and subsequent fire. The Investigation found that the Captain had failed to effectively manage the flight and that his consequent response to a resulting stick shaker activation had been completely contrary to applicable procedures and his training, leading directly to the loss of the aircraft. The aircraft operator s normal approach procedures were also determined to be inadequate and it was noted that prior to the accident, sterile flight deck procedures had been comprehensively ignored.

Description
On 12 February 2009, a Bombardier DHC-8-400 which was being operated by Colgan Air on a scheduled domestic passenger from Newark to Buffalo-Niagara under a Continental Airlines flight number as part of a codeshare agreement in place between the two operators was on an ILS approach to the destination runway in night VMC when control was lost and the aircraft crashed and burned in a residential area approximately 5 nm from the runway killing all occupants and one additional person on the ground.
The Investigation
The Investigation was carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB). It established that 47 year-old Captain, who had been PF for the accident flight had a total of 3,379 flying hours of which just 111 hours had been on type. He had been employed by Colgan for a little over 3 years. The 24 year-old First Officer had a total of 2,240 flying hours which included 774 hours on type, the latter all achieved after she had joined Colgan about a year prior to the accident.
It was found that the aircraft had been fully serviceable and not subject to any significant effects` attributable to ice accretion at the time of the accident. However, reference airspeeds set by the flight crew for the approach were not compatible with the position of the “reference speeds switch” which was in the “increase” (icing conditions) position which would therefore automatically trigger a stall warning in the form of a stick shaker activation at a higher airspeed.
As a result, when a stick shaker activation occurred at about 6nm from touchdown, the aircraft was actually around 20 to 22 knots above a stall rather than the a 5 to 7 knots which this activation normally indicates. The activation was automatically accompanied by autopilot disconnection automatically and the PF responded with a power increase and an abrupt aft movement on the control column. This had the effect of increasing the angle of attack (AOA) from +8° to +13° with a pitch attitude of about +18° and led to airspeed reducing from 131 kt at the onset of the stall to 125 kt. The airflow over the wing separated as the stall AOA was exceeded and a wing drop occurred. The Report concludes, following this description of the beginning of loss of control, that:
“the Captain’s inappropriate aft control column inputs in response to the stick shaker caused the airplane’s wing to stall”
Three stick pusher activations then followed in rapid succession, beginning as AoA reached +18 degrees. The Captain’s response to each of these was a successively increasing rearward force on the control column - the precise opposite of the applicable SOPs for such an event. As a result, the opportunity to regain control of the aircraft was lost.
The investigation also found that the intensity of the post crash fire had been aggravated by release of gas from a domestic supply pipe damaged by the aircraft ground impact. these issues are addressed to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)."
Findings
A total of 46 formally-documented Findings from the Investigation included the following:

The Captain’s inappropriate aft control column inputs in response to the stick shaker caused the airplane’s wing to stall
The minimal aircraft performance degradation resulting from ice accumulation did not affect the flight crew’s ability to fly and control the airplane
Explicit cues associated with the impending stick shaker onset, including the decreasing margin between indicated airspeed and the low-speed cue, the airspeed trend vector pointing downward into the low-speed cue, the changing colour of the numbers on the airplane’s indicated airspeed display, and the airplane’s excessive nose-up pitch attitude, were presented on the flight instruments with adequate time for the pilots to initiate corrective action, but neither pilot responded to the presence of these cues
the failure of both pilots to detect this situation was the result of a significant breakdown in their monitoring responsibilities and workload management
The Captain’s response to stick shaker activation should have been automatic, but his improper flight control inputs were inconsistent with his training and were instead consistent with startle and confusion
The Captain did not recognize the stick pusher’s action to decrease angle-of-attack as a proper step in a stall recovery, and his improper flight control inputs to override the stick pusher exacerbated the situation.
It is unlikely that the Captain was deliberately attempting to perform a tailplane stall recover
No evidence indicated that the (aircraft type involved) was susceptible to a tailplane stall.
The Captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight


enabled conversation that delayed checklist completion and conflicted with sterile cockpit procedures and
created an environment that impeded timely error detection.


The monitoring errors made by the accident flight crew demonstrate the continuing need for specific pilot training on active monitoring skills.
Colgan Air’s standard operating procedures at the time of the accident did not promote effective monitoring behaviour.
The pilots’ performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined.
Colgan Air did not proactively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at a predominantly commuter base.
Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty.
The current air carrier approach-to-stall training did not fully prepare the flight crew for an unexpected stall in the (aircraft type involved) and did not address the actions that are needed to recover from a fully developed stall.
The inclusion of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration icing video in Colgan Air’s winter operations training may lead pilots to assume that a tailplane stall might be possible in the (aircraft type involved), resulting in negative training.
The current Federal Aviation Administration surveillance standards for oversight at air carriers undergoing rapid growth and increased complexity of operations do not guarantee that any challenges encountered by the carriers as a result of these changes will be appropriately mitigated.
Mandatory flight operational quality assurance programs would enhance flight safety because all operators would have readily available data to identify operational risks and use in developing corrective actions.

The NTSB determined that the Probable Cause of the accident was "the Captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover".
Four Contributory Factors were also identified:

the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low speed cue,
the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures,
the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and
Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions."
