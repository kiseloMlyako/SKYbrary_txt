Description
Tonghua Sanyuanpu Airport also known as Tonghua Liuhe Airport, is a dual-use military and civilian airport serving the city of Tonghua in Jilin Province, China. It is located in the town of Sanyuanpu in Liuhe County, 50 km from the city center. Originally a military airport, construction to convert it for civilian use started in October 2009 with a total investment of 370 million yuan. The airport was opened on 18 June 2014, becoming the fifth civilian airport in Jilin.
Climatology
Tonghua Sanyuanpu has a rather dry, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate ( (Köppen climate classification Dwa)), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, like spring, sees little rain, but is crisp and short. The monthly daily average temperature in January is -3.7 °C, while in July it is 26.2 °C. Precipitation averages around 570 mm annually, with close to three-fourths of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,671 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes have ranged from -27.4 °C on 22 February 1966 to 42.6 °C on 15 June 1942.
