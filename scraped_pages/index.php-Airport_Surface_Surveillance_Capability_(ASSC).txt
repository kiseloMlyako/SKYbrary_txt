Description
Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) is a runway safety tool. With ASSC, both controllers and pilots with ADS-B In and cockpit displays see aircraft and ground vehicles on the airport surface, and on approach and departure paths within a few miles of the airport.
ASSC improves surface surveillance and situational awareness in all kinds of weather. ASSC is similar to a prior system deployed in the U.S. called the Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X).
The ASSC system receives input from:

ASDE-3 surface movement radar
ASSC multilateration remote units
ADS-B
Airport Surveillance Radar/Mode-S
Terminal automation for the flight plan data

ASSC fuses this data to produce a highly accurate display for controllers to show aircraft and ground vehicles on the surface movement area, and on arrival and departure routes. Pilots with TIS-B and cockpit displays can also receive ASSC data. This data is also transmitted to other FAA systems, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), SWIM, and Runway Status Lights.
Benefits
