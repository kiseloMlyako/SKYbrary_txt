Description
International airport serving Cantabria, north Spain.
Climatology
Because of the gulf stream, Cantabria, as well as the rest of "Green Spain", has a much more temperate climate than might be expected for its latitude. The region has a humid oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), with warm summers and mild winters. Annual precipitation is around 1,200 mm at the coasts and higher in the mountains. The mean temperature is about 14 °C. Snow is frequent in higher zones of Cantabria between the months of October and March. Some zones of Picos de Europa, over 2,500 metres high, have an alpine climate with snow persisting year round. The driest months are July and August, although droughts are unknown because rain is frequent and temperatures never get particularly high.
