Definition
Flight Time Limitations (FTL) are flying time restrictions (as opposed to duty time restrictions) imposed upon crew members by a regulatory agency. These limits can involve time restrictions per duty period, and for longer terms such has hours per week, per month, per quarter, or per year.
Description
To help prevent accidents brought on by fatigue, regulatory agencies around the world limit the number of hours that crew members can fly. These limits can vary depending on the type of flight operations. For example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has one set of limits that covers on-demand charter flights, and a more restrictive set of limits that covers scheduled airlines.
Other factors can impact these limits. For example, shorter limits may be imposed when flight crews report for duty very early in the morning or very late in the evening.
When a crew begins a scheduled flight, they must be able to complete the flight within the applicable FTLs. But in most circumstances, if unforeseen conditions arise, such as a course deviation for unexpected bad weather, crews and their employers are not held in violation.Â
