OGHFA (Operatorâ€™s Guide to Human Factors in Aviation)
Description
The Operators Guide to Human Factors in Aviation (OGHFA) is an extensive compendium of human factors information. The project was initiated by the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) European Advisory Committee, which includes EUROCONTROL representation.
The OGHFA material includes briefing notes, supporting checklists and visual training aids, as well as a series of situational examples which present users with real life examples based on accident and serious incidents.
Progressively published in 2009, OGHFA is hosted on SKYbrary within a separate OGHFA Portal.
