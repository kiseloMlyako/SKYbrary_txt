Description
On 18 January 2006, a Dornier 328 being operated by Austrian-registered airline Euromanx on a scheduled passenger flight from Isle of Man to Manchester avoided Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) during the approach at destination only by response to Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) following failure to capture the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Glideslope and a high rate of descent below it in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
Synopsis
The following is an extract taken from the Summary from the UK AAIB Report:
"The aircraft failed to capture the glideslope during an ILS approach in IMC conditions to Runway 24R at Manchester Airport. The operating crew did not monitor the flight path of the aircraft and were only alerted that they had descended (with a high vertical speed) dangerously close to the ground some 5.5 nm from touchdown, by a “GLIDESLOPE” aural alert triggered by the EGPWS. The commander disconnected the autopilot and performed a go-around. ATC provided radar vectors to re-position the aircraft for another ILS approach, following which the aircraft landed without further incident."
The report concluded:
"The crew were nearing the end of an uneventful flight in a serviceable aircraft. Due to a failure to operate the aircraft in accordance with SOPs, the safety of the aircraft was seriously compromised. A possible Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) accident was only avoided by the crew taking appropriate action upon being alerted by the EGPWS."
