Gunnison–Crested Butte Regional Airport, also known as Gunnison County Airport, is a public airport located at the southern edge of Gunnison, Colorado, USA.
Gunnison is located at the bottom of several valleys. Due to its location, cold air in all the valleys settles into Gunnison at night, making it, in winter, one of the coldest places in the United States, especially when snowpack is present.
