Description
Dongying Shengli Airport is an airport serving the city of Dongying in Shandong Province, China. It is located in the town of Yong'an, and was formerly called Dongying Yong'an Airport. Construction of the airport was started in May 1984 and completed in October 1985. It was expanded in 2001 and again in 2010. Flights resumed on 28 February 2011 after the latest expansion was completed, and the airport adopted the new name Dongying Shengli Airport, after the Shengli Oil Field in Dongying.
Climatology
Dongying Shengli has a rather dry, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate ( (Köppen climate classification Dwa)), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, like spring, sees little rain, but is crisp and short. The monthly daily average temperature in January is -3.7 °C, while in July it is 26.2 °C. Precipitation averages around 570 mm annually, with close to three-fourths of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,671 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes have ranged from -27.4 °C on 22 February 1966 to 42.6 °C on 15 June 1942.
