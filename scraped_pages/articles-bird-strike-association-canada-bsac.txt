Bird Strike Canada
Description
The goal of the Bird Strike Association of Canada (BSAC), or Bird Strike Canada, is to promote the best practice of wildlife management at airports in order to reduce the risk of wildlife strikes to aircraft. BSAC's mandate includes setting standards, promoting best practices, exchanging information, addressing industry issues by formulating effective strategies, and implementing change through regulatory means.
BSAC, which was established in 2009, is a not-for-profit organization led by a board of directors drawn from individuals and organizations responsible for, or interested in, the management of wildlife hazards at airports.
