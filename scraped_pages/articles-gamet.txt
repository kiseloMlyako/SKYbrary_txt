Definitions
GAMET area forecast. An area forecast in abbreviated plain language for low-level flights for a flight information region or sub-area thereof, prepared by the meteorological office designated by the meteorological authority concerned and exchanged with meteorological offices in adjacent flight information regions, as agreed between the meteorological authorities concerned.
Source: ICAO Annex 3
Area forecast for low-level flights means a forecast of weather phenomena for a flight information region or sub-area thereof, issued to cover the layer below flight level 100 (or below flight level 150 in mountainous areas, or higher, where necessary).
Source: EU Regulation 2017/373
Description
When the density of traffic operating below flight level 100 warrants the issuance of AIRMET information, area forecasts are prepared in a format as agreed between the meteorological authorities in the States concerned (GAMET being one of the options). When abbreviated plain language is used, the forecast is prepared as a GAMET area forecast, employing approved ICAO abbreviations and numerical values. When chart form is used, the forecast is prepared as a combination of forecasts of upper wind and upper-air temperature, and of SIGWX (significant weather) phenomena. 
Note: In EU legislation, the term "Area forecast for low-level flights" is used instead of "GAMET area forecast".
The forecasts cover the layer between the ground and FL 100 (or up to FL 150 in mountainous areas, or even higher, where necessary). It contains information on en-route weather phenomena hazardous to low-level flights, in support of the issuance of AIRMET information, and additional information required by low-level flights.
Format and content of GAMET area forecasts
Forecasts in the GAMET format are made in accordance of a designated template and comprise a header and two sections:

Section I, related to information on en-route weather phenomena hazardous to low-level flights, prepared in support of the issuance of AIRMET information. Elements which are already covered by a SIGMET message are omitted.
Section II, related to additional information required by low-level flights. This section may include additional elements (not specified in the template) in accordance with regional air navigation agreement.

Template
The header of the GAMET forecast contains the following fields (all are mandatory):

Location indicator of the FIR/CTA
Message identification (the text "GAMET")
Validity period
Location indicator of the meteorological office
Location indicator and name of FIR/CTA or part thereof

Section I contains the following fields (inclusion dependent on meteorological conditions):

Surface wind
Surface visibility
Significant weather
Mountain obscuration
Clouds (widespread BKN or OVC with base less than 1000 ft, CBs and TCUs)
Icing
Turbulence
Mountain wave
Applicable SIGMET messages

When no elements are included in Section I, the text "HAZARDOUS WX NIL" is used.
Section II contains the following fields (all except the sea-surface temperature and state are mandatory):

Pressure centres and fronts
Upper winds and temperatures
Clouds not included in Section I
Freezing level
Forecast QNH
Sea-surface temperature and state of the sea (optional element)
Volcanic eruptions

Amendments to GAMET area forecasts
When a weather phenomenon hazardous to low-level flights has been included in the GAMET area forecast and the phenomenon forecast does not occur, or is no longer forecast, a GAMET AMD shall be issued, amending only the weather element concerned.
