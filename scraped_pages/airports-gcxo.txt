Description
Airport serving the island of Tenerife. The main airport on the island is now Tenerife Sur/Reina Sofia.
Climatology
Dry-summer subtropical ”Mediterranean" climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) - characterized by hot, dry summers and mild winters. During the summer, subtropical high pressure cells dominate, making rainfall unlikely except for the occasional thunderstorm. In the winter, periodic storms bring rain (snow at higher elevations).
Because of its elevation, GCXO is prone to fog.
