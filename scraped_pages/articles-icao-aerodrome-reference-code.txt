Definition
The ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code is a two part categorisation of aircraft types which simplifies the process of establishing whether a particular aircraft is able to use a particular aerodrome. It is included in ICAO Annex 14. It has two 'elements', the first is a numeric code based on the Reference Field Length for which there are four categories and the second is letter code based on a combination of aircraft wingspan and outer main gear wheel span.
Description
Element 1 of the Code is as follows:



Code number
Aeroplane reference field length
Typical aeroplane




1
< 800 m
DE HAVILLAND CANADA DHC-6/PIPER PA-31


2
800 m but < 1200 m
ATR ATR-42-300/320/BOMBARDIER Dash 8 Q300


3
1200 m but < 1800 m
SAAB 340/BOMBARDIER Regional Jet CRJ-200


4
1800 m and above
BOEING 737-700/AIRBUS A-320



Field length means the balanced field length (which is when the take-off distance required is equal to the accelerate-stop distance required) if applicable, or take-off distance in other cases. Aeroplane reference field length is defined as "the minimum field length required for take-off at maximum certificated take-off mass, at sea level, in International Standard Atmosphere conditions in still air and with zero runway slope as documented in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or equivalent document.
Element 2 of the Code is derived from the most restrictive of either the aircraft wingspan or the aircraft outer main gear wheel span. The categories are as follows:



Code letter
Wingspan
Typical aeroplane




A
< 15 m
PIPER PA-31/CESSNA 404 Titan


B
15 m but < 24 m
BOMBARDIER Regional Jet CRJ-200/DE HAVILLAND CANADA DHC-6


C
24 m but < 36 m
BOEING 737-700/AIRBUS A-320/EMBRAER ERJ 190-100


D
36 m but < 52 m
B767 Series/AIRBUS A-310


E
52 m but < 65 m
B777 Series/B787 Series/A330 Family


F
65 m but < 80 m
BOEING 747-8/AIRBUS A-380-800



It should be noted that Element 2 is often used on its own since it has direct relevance to detailed airport design. It also has a parallel but differently defined code use by the FAA, the Airplane Design Group (ADG)
