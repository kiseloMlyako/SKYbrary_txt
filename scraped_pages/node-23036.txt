Definition
A Service Bulletin is the document used by manufacturers of aircraft, their engines, or their components to communicate details of modifications which can be made to aircraft. If an available modification is judged by the manufacturer to be a matter of safety rather than simply a product improvement, this would be issued as an Alert SB, in which case a corresponding Airworthiness Directive (AD) would usually then be issued by the appropriate NAA.
