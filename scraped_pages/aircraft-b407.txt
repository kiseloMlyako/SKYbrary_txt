The Bell 407 is a four-blade, single-engine, civil utility helicopter; a derivative of the Bell 206L-3 LongRanger. The 407 uses the four-blade, soft, in-plane, rigid rotor with composite hub that was developed for the United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior instead of the two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor of the 206L-3. The Bell 407 is frequently used for corporate and offshore transport, as an air ambulance, law enforcement, electronic news gathering and movie making.
