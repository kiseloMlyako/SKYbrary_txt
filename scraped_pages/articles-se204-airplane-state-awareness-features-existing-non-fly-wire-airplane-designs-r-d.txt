Status: COMPLETED
Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to reduce the risk of loss-of-control accidents by having manufacturers study the feasibility of incorporating certain recommended design features into current production and in-development non-Fly-By-Wire (non-FBW) transport category airplane (TCA) type designs. Features for study should include:

Low airspeed caution alerting
Bank angle alerting and recovery guidance display systems
Virtual day-Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) display systems, such as Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) or equivalent, which permit flight crews to operate in a day-VMC-like environment, regardless of external visibility
Energy state cues, such as flight path, acceleration, and speed deviation, in a manner similar to modern head-up displays for two scenarios:

as part of a virtual-VMC display, and
as a standalone implementation on the primary flight displays (PFD)



Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) will review the results of the studies with manufacturers and propose follow-on CAST safety enhancements for development and implementation of forward-fit production line changes and retrofit service bulletins for those combinations of models and features determined by the studies to be feasible.
A CAST study of 18 loss-of-control accidents and incidents resulting from flight crew loss of ASA determined that several design features, working separately or in conjunction, could have significantly reduced the likelihood of these accidents or incidents occurring.
