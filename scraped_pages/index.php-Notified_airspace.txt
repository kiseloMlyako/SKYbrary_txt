Description
Notified airspace is a generic term often used to describe any airspace where special conditions apply to flight within.
EUROCONTROL defines notified airspace as including controlled airspace (ICAO airspace classes A to E3, such as airways, TMAs, and CTRs), restricted airspaces (e.g.Prohibited, Restricted and Danger Areas, Temporary Reserved Airspace or airspace notified by a restriction of flying in accordance with national requirements) and aerodrome traffic information zones or areas (ATZ or TIZ) implemented by a number of European states.
Notified airspace may be controlled or uncontrolled.
