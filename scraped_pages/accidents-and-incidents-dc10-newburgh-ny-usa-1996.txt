Summary
The following is an extract from the Executive Summary of the National Transportation Safety Board (USA) (NTSB) report into this accident:
"…on September 5, 1996, a Douglas DC-10-10CF, N68055, operated by the Federal Express Corporation as flight 1406, made an emergency landing at Stewart International Airport, Newburgh, New York, after the flightcrew determined that there was smoke in the cabin cargo compartment….Three crewmembers and two nonrevenue passengers were aboard the airplane. The captain and flight engineer sustained minor injuries while evacuating the airplane. The airplane was destroyed by fire after the landing. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was an in-flight cargo fire of undetermined origin. Safety issues discussed…include flightcrew performance of emergency procedures, undeclared hazardous materials in transportation, dissemination of hazardous materials information, airport emergency response, and adequacy of aircraft interior firefighting methods…"
