Definition
Aviation Quality Database.
Description
AQD is a comprehensive and integrated set of tools to support Safety Management and Quality Assurance. Provides tools for data gathering, analysis and planning for effective risk management. It was developed on the premise that the key to knowing what action to take to correct quality and safety deficiencies is to understand their root causes. AQD can be used in applications ranging from a single-user database to include operations with corporate databases over wide-area networks. AQD gathers Incident, Accident and Occurrence Reports together with internal and external quality and safety audits for joint analysis. It also offers tools for creating internal audit programs, assisting with audits for all airline departments, tracking corrective and preventive actions, integrating external audit requirements and analysing and reporting trends in quality indicators.
