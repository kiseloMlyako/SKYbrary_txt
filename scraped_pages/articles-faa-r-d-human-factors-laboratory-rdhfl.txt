Description
FAA R & D Human Factors Laboratory (RDHFL) is a state-of-the-art FAA facility designed specifically to support research into Human Factors. It is dedicated to providing new insights into human performance, and assisting in the design of aviation systems that bring people and technology together. The RDHFL also contains a Virtual Reality (VR) capability where researchers can interact with three-dimensional, computer-generated representations of concepts, designs, and data sets that might otherwise be difficult to visualise.
The RDHFL is located at the FAA’s William J. Hughes Technical Center. It contains approximately 10 thousand square feet of laboratory space, including four experiment rooms that can be used independently or together. Links are provided between the RDHFL and some other government laboratories, including the NASA Ames Research Center.
