COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2021/2082 of 26 November 2021 laying down the arrangements for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the common European risk classification scheme - text published in the Official Journal of the European Union
Objective
To lay down the arrangements for the implementation of the common European risk classification scheme (ERCS) set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/2034.
Summary
The ERCS addresses the safety risk of an occurrence and not its actual outcome. The assessment of each occurrence determines the worst likely accident outcome that might have happened, and how close to that accident outcome the occurrence was.
The ERCS score is composed of two variables:

severity: the worst likely outcome in case the occurrence had escalated into an accident
probability: the likelihood of the occurrence to escalate into that outcome

The Annex to this Regulation lays down conversion procedures from RAT (Risk Analysis Tool) and ARMS ERC (Airline Risk Management Solutions Event Risk Classification) scores to the ERCS score.
The ERCS score can be obtained either by direct conversion or by using a manual conversion procedure, the former method being preferable. In any case, the aim is to achieve an equivalent ERCS classification.
The conversion process is summed up in the flow chart below:


On 31 March 2026 and every 5 years thereafter, each Member State will provide the European Commission and EASA with a report on the use of the ERCS.
The conversion procedures will be reviewed regularly by EASA to ensure their continuing relevance.
Corrigendum
A Corrigendum to this Regulation was published on 30.11.2021. In the Annex, section 1.2., point e., first indent, the correct reference is Figure 1 (the picture above) rather than Figure 2.
Entry into Force
The Regulation will enter into force in January 2023.
