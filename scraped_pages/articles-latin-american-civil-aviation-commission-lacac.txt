Description
The Latin American Civil Aviation Commission (LACAC) provides civil aviation authorities in its Member States a framework in which to discuss and plan the measures required for cooperation and coordination of their civil aviation activities. LACAC is a consultative body and its conclusions, recommendations and resolutions are subject to the approval of each Member State.
LACAC, which is based in Lima, Peru, and has 22 Member States, coordinates its work with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Membership is open to States located in South America, Central America (including Panama and Mexico) and the Caribbean States.
The organization's self-stated mission is to "promote the integration, cooperation, and coordination between the Latin American States in matters of air transport, air policy, airport management, capacity building, environment, facilitation, and aviation safety and security."
