Background
This safety enhancement will reduce wrong runway departures by addressing hazards identified in the Wrong Runway Safety Action Team Report relating to airport construction and runway/taxiway location. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory material will be updated to include risk analysis to address confusing taxiway and runway geometry, and airport geometry will be assessed during the Airport Layout Plan Review to identify potential hazards, develop mitigation plans and incorporate necessary changes.
