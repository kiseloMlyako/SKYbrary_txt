Most operators and many ATS units, aerodromes and maintenance organisations have established their own internal safety occurrence reporting system. This usually comprises a database into which safety occurrences reported by Air Safety Reports (ASRs) or by flight data monitoring are entered. All accidents and some incidents must also be reported to national authorities under the national accident and serious incident reporting system or mandatory occurrence reporting (MOR) systems.
Most organisations use ASR forms based on (or the same as) those used by the national MOR scheme, in order to standardise procedures and to reduce delay if it is decided by the employer that a MOR should be filed.
