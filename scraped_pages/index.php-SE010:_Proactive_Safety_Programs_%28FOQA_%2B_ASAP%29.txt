Background
This safety enhancement develops and implements a mutually agreed upon methodology to use de-identified Flight Operations and Quality Assurance (FOQA), and Aviation Safety Action Partnership (ASAP) information to identify safety-related issues and corrective actions. This will give operators the tools to identify safety issues and trends, and initiate corrective actions prior to an accident. It will also allow air carriers to share safety information.
The FOQA rule for disclosure protection of reported data was issued in October 2001. FOQA and ASAP are voluntary programs. FAA ASAP guidance was issued in January 2000 and revised in November 2002. The ASAP guidance is contained in AC120-66B.
