The Britten-Norman Trislander (more formally designated the BN-2A Mk III Trislander) is an 18-seat three-engined piston-powered civilian utility aircraft which was produced in the 1970s and early 1980s by UK manufacturer Britten-Norman. The aircraft were designed and produced on the Isle of Wight and at one point, they were assembled in Romania before being returned to the UK via Belgium for Certification. The type is no longer in production.
