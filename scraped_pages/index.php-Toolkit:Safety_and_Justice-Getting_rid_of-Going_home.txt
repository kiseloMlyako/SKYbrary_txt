One afternoon an alarm went of on an industrial site with multiple plants. It was unclear if this was an exercise or a real alarm. Also, it was not known from which of the plants the alarm had been triggered.
As standard procedure dictates, people went inside the office buildings and sealed doors and windows. The emergency crew counted everybody and checked the safety of the location. The alarm persisted. At some point, one of the people got up, started packing his stuff and said he was going home "because this was an exercise anyway". He ignored repeated instructions from the emergency staff and left the building, walking across the site to go home.
