Related Outputs
The aviation industry is using improved methods and technology to detect potential defects in aircraft engines. Working in partnership, government and industry are using enhanced inspections for certain high-energy rotating engine components. The initiative is based on an extensive analysis conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and industry on the historical causes of engine-related accidents. The FAA issued 23 Airworthiness Directives (ADs) requiring that operators inspect fan, high-pressure turbine and priority low-pressure turbine engine components.
