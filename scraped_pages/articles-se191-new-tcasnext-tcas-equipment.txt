Background
The purpose of this Safety Enhancement is to conduct the necessary study and research to determine if the currently-available versions of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) are adequate to support the traffic levels predicted in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Once the study is complete, the SE will create a strategy for development of the NextCAS system for implementation in the NextGen environment.
