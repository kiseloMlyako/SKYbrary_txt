Description
Qingdao Liuting International Airport is located in the city of Qingdao, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China and serves as the main airport for the city. It is about 31 km away from the city of Qingdao.
Climatology
Qingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that falls on the borderline between humid subtropical (Köppen Cwa) and humid continental (Köppen Dwa). Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of −0.5 °C. Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.3 °C. Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China. Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about 25 °C in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is 12.6 °C.
