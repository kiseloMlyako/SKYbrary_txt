Definition
Technical competencies are behaviours directly related to the the nature of training and the technical proficiency required to excercise effective control.
Competency on a task requires a match between the operator’s competencies and the competencies required to safely and effectively perform that task.
Competencies required to perform a task should be derived from the activities undertaken under ‘recruitment and selection’ activities.
Should the competencies required to perform a task change, a previously competent person may no longer be able to achieve ‘competence on task’. Regular assessment and recurrency training, especially using realistic simulators will ensure that previously demonstrated skills are retained, modified or added to as may be necessary.
