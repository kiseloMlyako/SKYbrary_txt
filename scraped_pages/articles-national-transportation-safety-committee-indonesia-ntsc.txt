Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT)
Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), also known as the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasu (KNKT), is responsible for the investigation of safety deficiencies in aviation, maritime, railway and road transportation.
Based on the result of its accident investigations, the NTSC issues recommendations to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents. The NTSC conducts research and studies necessary to perform these duties and to identify possible safety deficiencies.
The sole objective of its investigations is to prevent accidents and incidents, not to apportion blame or liability.
The NTSC was established by presidential decree in 2012 as a permanent independent institution responsible to the president of the Republic of Indonesia.
