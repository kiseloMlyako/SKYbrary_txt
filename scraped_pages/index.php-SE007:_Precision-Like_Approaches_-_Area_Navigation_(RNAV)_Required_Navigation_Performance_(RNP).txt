Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement adds Required Navigational Performance (RNP) criteria and guidance to FAA Order 8260.48, allowing for reduced landing minima. There are only a few air carriers that currently use RNP, and only on their newest airplanes. Authorization is granted by special operation specifications. This enhancement would allow all air carriers to use RNP for equipped aircraft.
Completed Outputs
Elements of this Safety Enhancement are covered in the FAA’s Aviation Systems Standards (AVN) plan to include vertical angles on instrument approach procedures.
