Description
ICAO Doc 8643 provides data on aircraft such as the Manufacturer, Model, Type designator, etc. One of the items is called Description and is a three-symbol code containing basic data about the aircraft:

The first symbol describes the aircraft type:

L - Landplane, e.g. A320. Note: A floatplane, which can temporarily be converted to a landplane or vice versa, is described as a landplane and not a seaplane or amphibian in ICAO Doc 8643.
S - Seaplane, e.g. HARBIN SH-5 (ICAO designator SH5)
A - Amphibian, e.g. LA4
G - Gyrocopter, e.g. A002
H - Helicopter, e.g. A109
T - Tiltrotor, e.g. V22


The second symbol specifies the number of engines 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or C, where C means that two engines are coupled to drive a single propeller system (e.g. C08T). The C symbol is only used for fixed-wing aircraft.
The third symbol specifies the engine type:

J - jet
T - turboprop/turboshaft
P - piston
E - electric
R - rocket



Examples

L2J - a landplane with two jet engines
H2T - a helicopter with two turboprop/turboshaft engines
S1P - a seaplane with one piston engine
