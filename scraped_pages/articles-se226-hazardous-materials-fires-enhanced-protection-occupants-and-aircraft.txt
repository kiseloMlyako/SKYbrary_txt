Background
This Safety Enhancement directs Air Carriers to provide additional training and equip their fleets (as feasible) with systems to enhance the protection of occupants and aircraft and increase the flightcrew’s ability to continue safe flight and landing in response to an onboard fire involving hazardous materials, including lithium batteries.
The following should be implemented, as feasible:

Installation of crew smoke mask/oxygen systems employing a single full face mask that can accommodate glasses and is equipped with state-of-the art communications technologies
Installation of systems to maintain pilots’ view of necessary flight information and, where possible, visual references outside the aircraft in dense continuous smoke conditions.
Installation of a system to upload emergency route information to aircraft using Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).
