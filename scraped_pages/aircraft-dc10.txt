  DC10






 

 





Long range airliner/freighter. In service since 1971. Tri jet development with the similar L-1001 TriStar. More powerful versions DC-10-30 and DC-10-40. Freighter version DC-10F, most common version today. KC-10 military tanker development. BOEING started a DC-10 modification program with MD-11 (two crew) cockpit. Production ceased 1989.
A major upgrade was launched in 1996 which included the retrofit of a glass cockpit. These aircraft were re-designated as MD-10 (the ICAO designator remained DC-10 though). The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 as well as  MD-11 landing gear, tyres and brakes.. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions.
The MTOM of aircraft converted through the MD-10 program increases as follows:

DC-10 Series 10: 202,304 kg with a payload of 65,091 kg for a non-stop range of approximately 2,000 nm;
DC-10 Series 30: 263,086 kg with a payload of 81,720 kg for a non-stop range of approximately 3,700 nm.
