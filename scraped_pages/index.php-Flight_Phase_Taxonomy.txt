Definition
The ADREP Flight Phase taxonomy is a set of terms used by ICAO to categorize the operational phase during which an aircraft accident and incident happened and to allow safety trend analysis on occurrences by this category. The ADREP Flight Phase taxonomy is part of the ICAO accident data reporting system (ADREP).
Terms
For the purposes of this taxonomy, phase of flight refers to a period within a flight. A flight begins when any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and continues until such time as all such persons have disembarked.
The terms of this taxonomy are grouped into primary and secondary terms. Every occurrence should have associated a primary flight phase and exceptionally only a secondary term.

Relations with other taxonomies
IATA maintains a taxonomy for flight phases. The terms used inside that taxonomy can be mapped to the terms of the ADREP flight phase taxonomy.
Multiple categories of one taxonomy sometimes match one category of the other taxonomy, but still allow comparison. The ADREP term maneuvering is unmatched as this mostly concerns non-commercial flights.
