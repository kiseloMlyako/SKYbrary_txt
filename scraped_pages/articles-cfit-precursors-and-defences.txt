Precursor Identification and Analysis
The traditional role of accident prevention has been to analyse accidents and serious incidents in order to determine their causal factors, and then to create defences with the aim of preventing recurrence. This fundamentally reactive approach takes no account of lesser events that have not – so far – had serious consequences.
Modern accident prevention strategies also take into account the circumstances which gave rise to these lesser events if it appears that a more severe outcome could have followed in only slightly different circumstances. This process is able to increase the body of precursors - events or factors - which can inform better accident prevention.
The process of identifying precursors should make use of safety data from any available safety reporting or monitoring scheme, such as:

Feedback from training (especially simulator) sessions;
Pilots’ reports;
Flight data analysis;
Line observations (e.g. Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA);
Survey and audit reports; as well as,
Accident and incident investigation.

Clearly, the sharing of lessons learned between operators, manufacturers and others is also important. This was the driving force behind the Global Aviation Safety Network (GAIN) initiative. Although this project has not been active for ten years or more, Reports of the various GAIN working groups are available at GAIN's webpage and some contain still-relevant content.
The IATA Safety Trend Evaluation, Analysis & Data Exchange System (STEADES), which has the world's largest database of de-identified narrative safety reports, provides its members (and others on payment of fees) with a means to access analysis based on this database. Such analyses can help various stakeholders in aviation safety develop safety management strategies.
Precursors of CFIT Events
Examples of CFIT precursors that have been identified are listed below. By definition, this list cannot be exhaustive and continuous efforts must be made to identify other precursors.
CFIT Precursors - Occurrences (Uneventful)

GPWS/TAWS alert/warning (genuine, nuisance or false)
MSAW warning
Other cases of reduced terrain separation
Prolonged loss of communication (PLOC) between pilot and controller(s)
Low-energy state during approach
Land short (runway undershoot) event
Low altitude pattern following a go-around
Inappropriate low altitude manoeuvring
Low-on-fuel condition/fuel starvation

CFIT Precursors - Deviations (Procedural/Flight Path)

Low pitch attitude/shallow flight path/altitude loss after lift-off
Flight below desired profile path during climb
Lateral deviation during climb (SID)
Descent/flight below segment or sector safe altitude
Altimeter setting error
Failure to check navigation accuracy before approach
Lateral deviation during approach (STAR)
Failure to revert to navaids raw data in case of doubts on automation
Incorrect or inappropriate radar vectoring by ATC (i.e., below minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) and/or toward high terrain)
Premature descent to the next step-down altitude during a multiple-steps-down non-precision approach
DME confusion (non-collocated DME versus ILS-DME), in identifying the final descent point
Premature descent to DA(H) before G/S intercept or premature descent to MDA(H) before final descent-point/FAF
Premature descent below MDA(H) before reaching the visual descent-point (VDP)
Flight below desired flight path during initial and/or final approach
Continued approach, when below DA(H) or MDA(H), after loss of visual references
Late or inadequate response to GPWS/TAWS alert/warning
Late or inadequate response to MSAW warning
Late or inadequate response to windshear warning
Unstabilized approach (steep or shallow approach)
Failure to go-around
Lack of effective flight path control during go-around
Failure to follow published missed-approach procedure
Inadequate fuel management

CFIT Defences and Controls
Identification of accident precursors is only half the battle; it is also necessary to define and implement defences and control strategies to address the threats involved.
Listed below are defence or control strategies that have been identified:

Industry prevention strategies and best practices (See also Further Reading)
Adherence to SOPs (task sharing, briefings, use of checklists, standard calls and excessive-deviation callouts, mutual crosscheck and backup)
Cross-check of takeoff data: mass and balance, fuel distribution, wind component, runway conditions, flaps setting, V1/Vr speeds, etc.
Adherence to sterile-cockpit rule
Adopting the constant-angle non-precision approach (CANPA)/constant descent final-approach (CDFA) concept
Use of an aircraft/airport-specific Engine Out Standard Instrument Departure (EOSID) in case of engine failure
Adequate use and supervision of automation
Vertical and horizontal flight paths monitoring (situational and energy awareness)
Altimeter setting cross-check
Cross-checking cleared altitude versus minimum safe altitude
Timely and adequate response to GPWS/TAWS alert or warning
Timely and adequate response to MSAW warning
Timely and adequate response to windshear alert or warning
Awareness of minimum vectoring altitudes
Awareness of approach design criteria (PANS-OPS versus TERPS)
Awareness of relationship between track distance to runway threshold and height (300 ft/nm rule-of-thumb)
Awareness of low-OAT correction to be added to minimum approach altitudes/heights
Awareness of minimum safe radio-altimeter readings for each approach segment (IAF-IF, IF-FAF)
Awareness of "black-hole" or other visual illusions for prevailing approach
Timely go-around
Adherence to published missed-approach procedure
Use of available aircraft technologies for enhanced situation awareness (vertical situation display, head-up display, enhanced-vision, etc.)

About Accident and Incident Precursors The role of accident and incident precursor identification and analysis is well described in the presentation and supporting article presented to the 2010 Flight Safety Foundation European Aviation Safety Seminar by Michel Tremaud. The article lists identified precursors and defences/controls for a range of different accident and incident types.
