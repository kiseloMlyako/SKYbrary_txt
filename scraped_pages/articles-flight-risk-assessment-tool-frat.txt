Description
A flight risk assessment tool (FRAT) is used by an operator, pilot, dispatcher or other personnel in advance of an upcoming flight to determine the risk level of that flight. Given that every flight has some level of risk, it is important for pilots or operators to differentiate between low risk and high risk flights, and to establish a review process and develop risk mitigation strategies to address flights throughout the risk range.
The format and complexity of FRATs can vary, but they generally ask a series of questions, or require the input of specific data, that help identify and quantify risk for a flight. 
Each operator should determine an acceptable level of risk for its flights based on the type of operation, environment, aircraft used, crew training, and overall operating experience. When the risk for a flight exceeds the acceptable level, the hazards associated with that risk should be further evaluated and the risk reduced. A higher risk flight should not be operated if the hazards cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level.
