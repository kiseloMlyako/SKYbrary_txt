HindSight
HindSight is a magazine on human and organisational factors in operations, produced by EUROCONTROL. The magazine is aimed primarily at operational staff, but also at other practitioners, in air traffic management and beyond. The purpose of HindSight magazine is to help staff at all levels in ATM and related sectors to improve performance at individual, group and organisational levels.
Articles include perspectives from operational staff, academics (including world-leading professors), safety and quality specialists, legal specialists, human and organisational performance specialists, psychologists, managers, regulators, and others concerned with human and organisational performance. While HindSight traditionally had an operational safety focus, this scope has expanded to consider performance more generally, with a particular focus on improving everyday work and performance as a whole.
The magazine has a wide readership. The primary readership is operational ATM and aviation staff, but the magazine is read by many in aviation, and beyond. Each issue also features a ‘views from elsewhere’ section with articles from sectors such as healthcare, rail, shipping, firefighting, manufacturing, nuclear power, and web operations and engineering.
Many articles first published in HindSight are referenced from within SKYbrary. In 2009, Tzvetomir Blajev, then the Editor-in-Chief, accepted the Flight Safety Foundation Cecil Brownlow Publication Award on behalf of HindSight magazine.
The current Editor-in-Chief (since 2017) is Dr Steven Shorrock. The Editor-in-Chief is assisted by an editorial team within and outside EUROCONTROL (with front-line ATM/aviation experience), who also act as peer reviewers, and a graphic designer.
