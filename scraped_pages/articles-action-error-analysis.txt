Action Error Analysis (AEA)
Description
Action Error Analysis analyses interactions between machine and humans. Is used to study the consequences of potential human errors in task execution related to directing automated functions. Very similar to FMEA, but is applied to the steps in human procedures rather than to hardware components or parts. Any automated interface between a human and automated process can be evaluated, such as pilot/cockpit controls, or controller/display, maintainer / equipment interactions.
