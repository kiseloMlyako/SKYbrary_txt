Description
The principal purpose of New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) is to determine the circumstances and causes of select aviation, marine and rail accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future rather than to ascribe blame. The commisison was established by the TAIC ACT of 1990.
The TAIC comprises five commissions supported by a chief executive and professional staff.
