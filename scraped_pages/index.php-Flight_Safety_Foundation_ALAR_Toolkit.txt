The Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) toolkit is is a collection of tools and awareness material designed to help reduce the frequency and severity of approach and landing accidents and incidents, including controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
The toolkit is the product of work which was carried out by the FSF international ALAR Task Force and published in 1998. The primary database supporting the conclusions was a set of 76 approach and landing accidents which occurred between 1984 and 1997.
The ALAR Briefing Notes (see Further Reading below) are a fundamental component of the Toolkit. The following Briefing Notes are particularly relevant to CFIT avoidance:

BN 1.1 through 1.6
BN 2.1 through 2.4
BN 3.1 and 3.2
BN 5.1 through 5.4
BN 6.1 through 6.4
BN 7.1 through 7.4

The principal elements of the English language toolkit are available in SKYbrary. The complete toolkit on CD is available for sale from FSF in English, Spanish and Russian language versions (Copies of the FSF ALAR Toolkit may be obtained from the Flight Safety Foundation ALAR Toolkit Web-site).
