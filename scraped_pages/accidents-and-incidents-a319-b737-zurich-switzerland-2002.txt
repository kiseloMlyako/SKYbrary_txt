Description
On 23 November 2002, an AIRBUS A-319, landing on Rwy16 at Zurich Switzerland, narrowly missed collision with a B737 cleared for take off on an intersecting runway.
Synopsis
The following is an extract from the official Swiss BFU report into the event:
"During the approach on the runway 14 instrument landing system (ILS) the [A319] asked the aerodrome controller (ADC) about the possibility of a swing-over to runway 16. At this time the aircraft was at a distance of approximately 3.1 nm from the threshold of runway 14. The competent aerodrome controller gave clearance for this to the [A319], indicating that an aircraft was on take off roll on runway 28. Seventeen seconds after the clearance for the swing-over, [the A319] also received landing clearance for runway 16.
At the moment of issuing landing clearance to [the A319] the ADC was already involved for several minutes in an extensive dialogue with a previously under instrument flight rules (IFR) departed Cessna 172. These time-consuming radio communications were necessary because the Cessna’s transponder was not functioning.
In the meantime, in accordance with a previous clearance from the ADC, the next aircraft scheduled to take off, a Tunisair Boeing 737…, had aligned itself on runway 28 and had made ready for take-off. 1:25 minutes after [the A319] had received landing clearance for runway 16, [the B737] received take-off clearance from the ADC for runway 28. At this time [the A319] was about to touch down on runway 16. Shortly after touching down on runway 16, the flight crew of [the A319] became aware of [the B737], which was taking off. The CMD immediately initiated full braking of the Airbus 319. As a result it was possible to bring the [A319] to a halt about 50 m north of the shoulder of runway 28. From this standstill position, the flight crew of [the A319] observed the [the B737] which was taking off low over the runway intersection…"
