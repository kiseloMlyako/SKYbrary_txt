Description
A Loading Instruction Form (or LIF) is the usual description of the specification for required aircraft Loading of Aircraft Holds that is completed by the assigned dispatcher or equivalent agent and passed to the assigned hold loading supervisor. Once compliant loading has been achieved, confirmation of that fact is formalised by the physical return of the signed LIF to the assigned dispatcher. That formalisation is required prior to the dispatcher presenting the final load and trim sheet to the aircraft commander. Alternative electronic signalling of compliance may be substituted, as may similar specification of the original loading instructions from the assigned Dispatcher to the Loading Supervisor.
