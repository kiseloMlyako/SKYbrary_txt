Background
This safety enhancement helps prevent midair collisions by:

Requiring flightcrews to follow Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Resolution Advisories (RA’s) even in the presence of contravening ATC instructions;
Establishing procedures for TCAS range setting; and
Requiring that TCAS-capable simulators and flight-training devices be used for training TCAS responses and maneuvers.
