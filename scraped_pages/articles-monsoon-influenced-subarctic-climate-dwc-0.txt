Dwc: D = Continental  w = Dry winter  c = cool summer
Description
Monsoon-influenced (meaning seasonal precipitation) subarctic; great seasonal changes in temperature with the coldest month averaging below 0 °C and 1–3 months averaging above 10 °C. At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter (alternative definition is 70% or more of average annual precipitation is received in the warmest six months).
Climates classified as Dwc, with a dry winter, are found in parts of East Asia, like China, where the Siberian High makes the winters colder than places like Scandinavia or the Alaska interior but extremely dry (typically with around 5 millimeters of rainfall equivalent per month), meaning that winter snow cover is very limited. The Dwc climate can be found in much of Mongolia, southern Siberia (Irkutsk, Russia) , central China and Nepal (e.g. Mohe Gulian, China, and Lukla, Nepal), parts of northern India and North Korea.
