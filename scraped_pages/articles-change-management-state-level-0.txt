Description
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to Aviation Regulatory Authorities dealing with change management at the State level.

Rather, this document focuses on the need for, and benefits of, change management and the type of changes commonly seen at the State level from the perspective ofÂ  Aviation Regulatory Authorities. This document also includes a typical change management process, tools, and guidance, and provides examples to illustrate the change management process.
