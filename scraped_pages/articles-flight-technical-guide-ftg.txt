Description
The term Flight Technical Guide (FTG) is widely used in Japan and some other states, and it describes an aircraft operator’s guidance with respect to aircraft operation and the associated pilot education and training. Where one is issued, it is a supplement to the prescribed regulations and standards contained in an Operations Manual (OM) but subordinate to them.
EU-OPS Requirements
The structure and content of the Operations Manual is detailed in EU-OPS 1.1045 and the referenced Appendix. In essence, the Operations Manual comprises four parts:

Part A. General/Basic. This part comprises all non type-related operational policies, instructions and procedures needed for a safe operation.
Part B. Aeroplane Operating Matters. This part comprises all type-related instructions and procedures needed for a safe operation. It accounts for any differences between types, variants, or individual aeroplanes used by the operator.
Part C. Route and Aerodrome Instructions and Information. This part comprises all instructions and information needed for the area of operation.
Part D. Training. This part comprises all training instructions for personnel required for a safe operation.
