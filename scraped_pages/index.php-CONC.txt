Supersonic airliner. In service from 1976 to October 2003. Four turbojet engines with afterburner (used in T/O and during transition to supersonic speeds). The nose section can be lowered down during T/O and Landing to give the pilots better visibility. Operated only by British Airways and Air France. High maintenance requirements after the Paris accident in July 2000 led to complete retirement. Total of 20 aircraft were built, 16 were operational. Max speed was Mach 2.00
Note: The ICAO Designator CONC has been removed from ICAO Doc 8643 as aircraft of this type noÂ longer exist in airworthy condition.
