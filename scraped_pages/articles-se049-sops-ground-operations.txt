Detailed Implementation Plan
Related Outputs
Advisory Circular 120-74B, Flightcrew Prcedures During Taxi Operations, was issued to provide Standard Operating Procedures for ground operations. Also issued was Flight Standards Handbook Bulletin for Air Transportation (HBAT) 04-04, Incorporating Standard Operating Procedures During Taxi Operations in Training Programs, the Use of SOPs During Taxi Operations, and Special Emphasis Inspection Items for Runway Incursion Surveillance. The HBAT has since been cancelled and the guidance incorporated into other material, but is included here for the information it contains.
