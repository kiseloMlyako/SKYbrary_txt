Detailed Implementation Plan for
SE-24 Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Aircraft Design – Continuing Airworthiness
Statement of Work
The purpose of this project is to promote incorporation of fault tolerant design principles for flight critical system components and to facilitate critical-point, flight-realistic-condition, certification testing/analysis. Changes to flight critical system components will be considered a major change unless the applicant can show the change is in fact a minor change and monitors the continued airworthiness (in-service failures) of these systems using a risk assessment focused methodology.
