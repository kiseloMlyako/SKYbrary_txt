Description
The Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) is a U.S.-based membership organization founded in 1953 by a group of aviation enthusiasts who were interested in building their own airplanes. In the ensuing decades it grew into an international organization representing recreational aviation. Its mission is to grow participation in aviation. It has more than 240,000 members. 
EAA's annual EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, often draws more than 500,000 attendees during its week-long run.
