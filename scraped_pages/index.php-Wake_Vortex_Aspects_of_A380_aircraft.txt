Information from ICAO

You may recall the EUROCONTROL Safety Warning message “ICAO Interim Guidance, regarding A380 Wake Turbulence Separation Minima” from 30/01/2006.
The ad-hoc group of experts under the auspices of the United States Federal Aviation Administration, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL), the Joint Aviation Authorities and the manufacturer has now recommended to ICAO more specific guidance, based on the completed flight test programme.
Accordingly, revised guidance has now been issued by ICAO (ICAO Regional Director TEC/OPS/SEP (T11/72) - 06-0320.SLG from 9 October 2006) related to wake turbulence aspects of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft.
All guidance previously issued by ICAO on the subject of Airbus A380 wake vortex aspects and the EUROCONTROL Safety Warning message from 30/01/2006 are superseded.
