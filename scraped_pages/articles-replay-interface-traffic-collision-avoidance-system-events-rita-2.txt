Description
Replay Interface of Traffic Collision Avoidance System Events (RITA) was initially developed by Centre d’Etudes de la Navigation Aérienne (CENA) in 1995 for the ACAS training of French controllers. RITA 2 is a new PC-based European version whose main objectives are to include TCAS II Version 7 events and to implement modern radar and TCAS displays. A library of TCAS alert events are being assembled, selected based on their relevance to training needs.
RITA 2 is an experience feedback tool for the training of air traffic controllers and to reinforce the training of flight crews. It shows on the same screen what both pilots and controllers could see and a transcript of what was said. Although individual use is possible, RITA is best used by instructors in briefing sessions with small groups of pilots and controllers. It’s display is divided into three main parts:

A visual display simulating the radar display provided by radar recordings
A visual display of the pilot’s view on either:

An Instantaneous Vertical Speed Indicator (IVSI) or
An Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), with the associated aural alarms


Display of the transcript of voice communication between controller(s) and pilots.
