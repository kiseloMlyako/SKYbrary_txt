Status: COMPLETED
Background
This safety enhancement ensures that ground-based radars and their associated by-products provide the necessary levels of terrain avoidance protection to aircraft operating domestically within the United States and that air traffic controller MSAW training is adequate and appropriate to operate.
Completed Outputs
All current MSAW data was verified for accuracy. All MSAW systems were checked and a plan for re-check every 540 days was developed. ATC controllers were provided with initial and recurrent training on the use of MSAW.
