Description
A Dutch roll is a combination of rolling and yawing oscillations that occurs when the dihedral effects of an aircraft are more powerful than the directional stability. A Dutch roll is usually dynamically stable but it is an objectionable characteristic in an airplane because of its oscillatory nature.
