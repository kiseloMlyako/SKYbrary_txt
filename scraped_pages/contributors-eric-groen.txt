Prof. Eric Groen, PhD is senior scientist at TNO in Soesterberg (The Netherlands), and Visiting Professor at Cranfield University (United Kingdom) with expertise in aerospace human factors, such as spatial disorientation, startle and surprise, and hypoxia, which (worst-case) may lead to loss of control in-flight, or controlled flight into terrain.
An important part of his research is aimed at validating simulator technologies that allow for the reproduction of critical flight conditions in a ground-based environment.
